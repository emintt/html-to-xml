class="c1"><span class="c6">A common question is how is a prototype different from a proof of concept or a pilot? It seems that over different industries, these terms may be used interchangeably. But they do, by definition, have different meanings. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">In a simple way, in this process, these three different terms actually form more of a linear process where you start with a proof of concept then move to the prototype and then finally move onto some kind of pilot. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">When you have done your research and you know the needs and wants of your customers, you can more easily create a proof of concept - the very first iteration of any solution. The prototype is the next stage of development. It is a physical or digital manifestation of the idea/concept that you created on paper. This Chapter on Experimenting will be primarily looking at using the Proof of Concept and Prototype parts of the process. </span></p><table class="c17"><tr class="c38"><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c52">&#65279;</span></p></td><td class="c40" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Proof of Concept</span></p></td><td class="c13" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Prototype </span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Pilot </span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Scope</span></p></td><td class="c40" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Small sample of the concept</span></p></td><td class="c13" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">One-off simulation of part of the concept</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Continuous- full test use </span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Fidelity</span></p></td><td class="c40" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Very low fidelity</span></p></td><td class="c13" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Low fidelity</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Medium to high fidelity</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Functionality</span></p></td><td class="c40" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Certain aspects- non-functional</span></p></td><td class="c13" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Experimental- with shortcuts and such to minimise time spent</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Functionally complete</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Usage</span></p></td><td class="c40" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">To flesh out the concept</span></p></td><td class="c13" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">For demonstration purposes</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Limited to a small number of users</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">When created?</span></p></td><td class="c40" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Beginning of development cycle</span></p></td><td class="c13" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Early in development cycle</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">First launch</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Reason for development</span></p></td><td class="c40" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">To see if there is any merit to the idea at all</span></p></td><td class="c13" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">To see if people will like the service</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">To get real user feedback</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c12"><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Outcome</span></p></td><td class="c40" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">To know if you should proceed to prototype</span></p></td><td class="c13" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Good for solving ambiguity</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Used to prepare to scale up production</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1"><span class="c54">&#65279;</span></p><h2 class="c41" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c7 c25">Value from prototyping</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c6">When you look at the failure rates of new companies, especially the ones in the start-up space, you will notice that there are common reasons why they failed. You will find three common denominators - Time, Money, and Market. Whether it took too long to get to market, they burned through their cash, there was no market need for the &ldquo;solution&rdquo;, or there were pricing issues or business model issues, the research says launch fast, fail fast, regroup. </span></p><p class="c14"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 306.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 306.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Prototyping is a way to test ideas early and more cheaply. Often individuals or teams want to have a nice-looking product or a more complete product ready before they test it in the marketplace but this leads to delays and burning through cash faster. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Delays and perfectionism is even more of a problem in traditional businesses where there is less of an atmosphere of trial and error and a mindset of failing is learning. This old mindset is one of the biggest obstacles to overcome in traditional business settings. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">When you test your ideas and concepts early enough, you have not made huge investments into their development yet and this means that your time investment is less, your learning timeline is shortened and you are able to get a tested concept onto the market much faster with fewer problems. This saves time and money. And it also makes sure that the market is ready for what you are offering (because you have already asked and tested it). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Sometimes technologies are just too advanced to be supported out in the market by enough people. You can see that this is what happened with Google Glasses. Huge hype but in the end, the public didn&rsquo;t want what they had developed. There was never a way to use the technology the way the developers would have liked because the (larger) market didn&rsquo;t support it. It wasn&rsquo;t solving a real problem that people had. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c22">Unfortunately, many times, businesses continue down development routes that aren&rsquo;t looking promising because of the concept of</span><span class="c53"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1733405697979064&amp;usg=AOvVaw0AfViMCgLakVQaTlO9BBDR">&nbsp;sunk cost</a></span><span class="c6">.

A prototype needs to be used with real or potential customers to get any actionable feedback. A prototype helps people see the idea better.

One of these differences is related to the ways in which you actually prototype them (this will be explored in the next section). The other main difference is why you are prototyping.

Your imagination is the limit. This is, of course, as long as it makes sense to make it from that.

This is especially true if you are testing them with customer volunteers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">It is also important to know if you will be testing them first internally or if you immediately test external to your team/organisation.

The right prototype type should be used to get the most out of talking to your audience. It is important to keep in mind that when you are gathering feedback on your prototype, you want it to be as unbiased and as honest as possible. Here are a few things that you need to keep in mind when testing your prototype:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c22 c37">Avoiding a very polished prototype will generally help people be less shy about giving you negative feedback. </span><span class="c6">If it is too polished, they may feel like you have invested a lot of time and effort into it. This is not what you want. Sometimes less polished will get you better quality feedback.</span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_stvo8k3xcvtk-0 start"><li class="c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Take a step back from the prototype. This means maybe speaking in more neutral terms about the creation of the prototype (instead of &ldquo;we have created this prototype/product/service, replace that with &ldquo;this prototype/product/service has been designed/created&hellip;&rdquo;). People don&rsquo;t want to hurt your feelings if they think that this is something that you personally have created</span></li><li class="c15 c44 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Asking open questions when wanting to know how easy/difficult they found it</span></li><li class="c15 c44 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Be specific of the function/action you want them to try to complete.</span></li><li class="c36 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">You don&rsquo;t need to have a lot of testing sessions to get the majority of the feedback.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c6">The best way to test a prototype is always with the people who would be using the service but to be honest, that isn&rsquo;t always possible. If you can&rsquo;t get a few real users, then second best is to have testers who have no idea about what you are doing. There is no point in having someone who knows more about the service than an average user would. The amount of value that brings is minimal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c7">[VISUAL]</span></p><h3 class="c24" id="h.3whwml4"><span class="c0">Preparing for Testing</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Low fidelity digital prototypes (either paper mockups or digital mockups) are easy to take to users. Don&rsquo;t be embarrassed by their lack of a polished look. Research has shown that users are more likely to suggest useful changes to something that they know is still a work in progress. In other words, if it looks too polished, they are less likely to be honest as they see all the hard work that has gone into it and they don&rsquo;t want to disappoint you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Just like when you created an interview guide for doing your customer interviews, you can create the same kind of document at the prototyping stage. First you should create the question guide so that the prototype testing is consistent and comparable. Then you should create a form to collect the answers to the questions. Decide what you want to test and decide what outcomes you are looking for.</span></p><h4 class="c20" id="h.2bn6wsx"><span class="c10 c7">Who tests it?</span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c6">There are two sides to testing your prototype. The testers and the users.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">The testers </span><span class="c6">should be the people who are involved in creation of the prototype. It might be required that you need someone who is a specialist in digital services but both people should be involved. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">The users </span><span class="c6">should be representatives of the actual users and possibly the providers. It needs to make sense and be easy to use for both sides of the service. If it is a physical service, then testing it with both perspectives - the provider and the user - is important but if it is more of a one-sided digital service, then just testing it with the end user, that is ok. </span></p><h4 class="c20" id="h.qsh70q"><span class="c10 c7">How many tests?</span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c6">In terms of numbers of tests, you can limit these to 5 or so for each round. There is no need to do an immense amount of testing to get an understanding of most of the issues. This is very similar to the rules that apply when doing in-depth customer research that we looked at in Chapter 2. </span></p><h4 class="c20" id="h.3as4poj"><span class="c10 c7">How do you find the users who will test your prototype? </span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c6">This is an interesting question because there are several ways to obtain people to test your prototypes. It is important to understand that you should set these up before your prototype is ready to avoid wasting time. You will need to set a deadline for the prototype to be ready and then make sure that your users have an appointment for a test before that deadline. Another thing that you need to consider is whether you will provide the user with a reward for taking part. These can be vouchers for going to the cinema, gift cards for local stores, or something like an online voucher of some kind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">First, you can ask real company users of your service. Maybe a general email can be sent out asking for those interested in being testers on the next project - include in this email whether there will be some kind of reward for their time and effort. Second, you can put a request in different facebook groups that have your user persona as members (make sure you ask permission from the group owner if it is not you), this also goes for other social media sites. The last one mentioned here is to spend some money on social media advertising. This is useful because you can target who sees the ad which should replicate your persona as much as possible. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="c20" id="h.1pxezwc"><span class="c10 c7">Documenting your tests</span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Along with the interview guide itself, you should create a form of some kind to record the answers. Maybe you can create a scoring system with linear scales on how easily different actions were performed along with notes. It is probably most important to make sure that the notes from the session are good. This may require that there is more than just the person testing the prototype with the user. A good idea, when possible, is that there is another person there to take accurate notes about how the process went.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">A standardised record sheet is great to use if multiple people are conducting the tests. This makes sure that the information that is gathered is understandable by others if for some reason the interviewer cannot present the feedback. It is also good to have this in a common form when gathering the insights from the information and in using those insights to create changes to the prototype. </span></p><h3 class="c24" id="h.49x2ik5"><span class="c0">Using the Feedback</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Having created the prototype and conducted the tests, you now have more information about your product/service from actual users. Going back to how we dealt with information earlier in the process, you can stick the important points onto sticky notes and onto a wall. This can be done in two ways, either each person who conducted interviews can do this by themselves in front of the group while telling the story of each user, or the interviewer can tell the story and then the people listening can write sticky notes and put them up when they hear interesting points. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">It is also important to collect the data points that you&#39;re specifically tested to see how many people found it easy, difficult, or confusing to perform the tasks that you asked them to do. These exercises will help you to identify the insights that came from the interviews. These insights will inform how you iterate your concept further.</span></p><h3 class="c41" id="h.2p2csry"><span class="c0">Iterating your concept</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Using the identified insights, identify the parts of the product or service that you will iterate. Using these insights, you will decide if you will also upgrade the overall look and feel of the prototype for the next round of prototype testing. This may or may not be useful or necessary, you need to decide this. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">An example of this upgrade could be seen as going from a paper prototype for the first round to a hybrid or digital prototype for the second round. With more refined processes, it may be worth investing more effort into the look and feel of the prototype as you get closer to the finished product. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c7">[ITERATION VISUAL]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Once you have iterated your prototype, it is probably time to organise a few more tests to make sure that what you did actually fixed the problem(s). This process goes on until you are happy that enough people will be able to use your service or product without much issue. Remember, if many people have issues, this will ramp up your costs in customer service.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c16 c42">Always be ready to follow the evidence- Love the Problem, Not the Solution!</span></p><h4 class="c20" id="h.147n2zr"><span class="c10 c7">To help people give more unbiased feedback you should:</span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c11">not show a very polished prototype</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">tell them what to say</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c11">speak in neutral terms</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c11">be specific on the actions you want them to perform</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c11">ask open questions</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">tell them how hard you worked on it</span></p><h4 class="c20" id="h.3o7alnk"><span class="c10 c7">When you need to initially test your prototype, how many people should you test it with?</span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c6">20+</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c11">5-10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">50+</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Just your mother</span></p><h4 class="c20 c51" id="h.23ckvvd"><span class="c10 c7"></span></h4><h4 class="c20" id="h.ihv636"><span class="c10 c7">After completing this Chapter you should be able to:</span></h4><ul class="c34 lst-kix_fmpy0hz9k6su-0 start"><li class="c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Demonstrate multiple methods to prototype a service or product </span></li><li class="c15 c44 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Describe why prototyping is a valuable way to develop and test concepts</span></li><li class="c36 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Experiment with low-fidelity prototypes to iterate and increasingly improve during the testing phase</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c39"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c39 c46"><span class="c4"></span></p></body></html>
