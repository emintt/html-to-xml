Problem</span></h1><h2 class="c0" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c3">Why you probably don&#39;t know the real problem</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c1">In traditional problem solving methods, it is normal to jump to an assumption of the problem(s). This happens when someone states that there is a problem and that there should be a &ldquo;brainstorming session&rdquo; to solve the problem. This action of jumping to brainstorm solutions with just an internal team is not very helpful when trying to solve real problems.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Each employee will have a piece of a customer&rsquo;s experience or story either through direct contact or second hand information. But this is not a reliable place to start. Every person has only a piece of a larger puzzle. The assumption may be correct for one piece but once put into a larger context, it no longer is the right problem to solve.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c17"><a class="c22" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hbr.org/2012/09/are-you-solving-the-right-problem&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731120022537588&amp;usg=AOvVaw3AjgKiXQBnRSIPRRXHElD-">Real problems</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;take time to understand. By jumping to solutions too early, you may end up solving something that is a symptom of the larger problem and not the problem itself. The organisation may also miss out on other opportunities or waste resources by solving the wrong problem. </span></p><h3 class="c10" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c6">When helping doesn&#39;t help</span></h3><p class="c8"><span class="c1">One of the biggest ideation problems is that people really want to help. Why is that a problem? you ask. &nbsp;Well, it is a problem because it tends to have people rush ahead trying to solve the problem with only these small pieces of the puzzle without knowing where the corners or the edge pieces are. What the situation really needs is an understandable framework where certain processes are followed. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Without the customer research at the beginning of this process, you will not be able to determine which is the right problem to solve. This is why the first part of the service design process is sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;Do the right thing&rdquo; phase. Working your way through the &ldquo;Do the right thing&rdquo; phase with proper research and discovery will then lead you to the &ldquo;Do the thing right&rdquo; half. This stage is all about making sure that you solve the problem in the best, most impactful way possible.</span></p><h2 class="c0" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c3">Doing the right thing</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c2">[DOUBLE DIAMOND VISUAL]</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 have shown how to do the research, how to decide and create one or more personas, it explained how each persona has their customer journey and how to identify the low points on the emotional journey. From this information, it is possible to determine which potential problems we can aim to solve. Depending on the level of the journey map, will tell us how specific or general a problem is. If the journey map is quite high level, meaning level 1 or 2, then it would be useful to drill down to a deeper level on that specific part of the customer journey. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">In our example in Chapter 2 when we looked at the problem with calling the service, it is unknown what part of that process was problematic from the level of the journey map. It is possible that this information came out in the customer research, so it is important to look there again and map the service more in detail. It is important to know if the problem is with finding the phone number, being on hold for too long, being passed around from different people, etc. You just don&rsquo;t necessarily know. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Once you have confirmed that you have a real problem to solve, it is important to make sure that you are solving it in the right way. That leads us to the second phase: &ldquo;Do the thing right&rdquo;.</span></p><h2 class="c0" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c3">Doing the thing right</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c2">[DOUBLE DIAMOND VISUAL]</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c13">Once the research is done, the problems have been identified and narrowed down to one or two that you want to fix, now it is time to look at how you can start to tackle the problem. In order to start to tackle the problem(s) you have identified, you need to refine your problem into an answerable question. A question that is not too narrow and not too broad. This question will be the foundation of being able to &ldquo;Do the thing right&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c7 c37">You need to refine your problem into an answerable question.</span></p><h3 class="c10" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c6">How might we create an actionable question?</span></h3><p class="c8"><span class="c1">The sub-title of this section is a clue as to how we create the actionable question that we want to answer. These questions always start with &lsquo;How Might We&rsquo; and are referred to as &lsquo;how might we&rsquo; questions or even HMW questions. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">The reason for the words How Might We is simple. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">How </span><span class="c1">- this invites questioning, admits there is a problem, is solution-oriented, and open &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Might </span><span class="c1">- this word accepts and encourages many different ideas and encourages optimism that it can be accomplished</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">We </span><span class="c1">- tells us that it is a collaborative effort, that not just one person has the answer</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">The anatomy of the How Might We question is important because it is a team effort. No idea or solution comes out fully formed. It is when you bring together the knowledge of the research, the experience of the team and the person facilitating the process, you will have a very constructive ideation session. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c2">[VISUAL]</span></p><h3 class="c10" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span class="c6">The Goldilocks problem</span></h3><p class="c8"><span class="c1">In pursuing the How Might We question to lead your ideation, you need to avoid the Goldilocks problem - not too big, not too small, but just right.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">When the problem question is too large, you will be unable to solve the problem with the time and resources you have available. When the problem is too narrow, it is usually suggesting a solution already in the problem.</span></p><p class="c8"><span>Stanford&rsquo;s d.school has</span><span class="c17"><a class="c22" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/how-might-we-questions&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731120022540663&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Vt9sMs-QGOE2L3nSelTE1">&nbsp;a great example</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of this balance regarding ice cream. Here is a visual that recreates the spectrum and balance: </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c13">[HMW QUESTION VISUAL]</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">In this example, you can see how the first HMW question is too narrow because it is already suggesting a solution in the form that narrows the solution to a cone of some type. Technically, if you wanted to go along this route, you could change the HMW question to HMW create an ice cream eating experience without any mess? The thing that you need to remember is that there is not ONE right question. There can be many questions that work. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">The last example, &ldquo;HMW redesign dessert?&rdquo;, is really far too broad. It is not even possible to answer this question. First, the term dessert is different to many different people and/or cultures. Second, redesign dessert from what? It is impossible to do this. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">In the middle is a question that has the right amount of curiosity, challenge, and possibility. This is a question that allows for many different answers and solutions. It is possible to explore many different options before deciding on one, two or three to prototype later on. It means that all options are on the table. This is also an example as to why you should, as the saying goes, &ldquo;love the problem, not the solution&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">As long as you are loving the problem (basically, the HMW question) you are open to any solution from anywhere. It won&rsquo;t necessarily come from the loudest or highest-ranking person in the room. It probably won&rsquo;t come from one person at all. Great solutions do not come out fully formed, they are a combination of ideas, feedback, iterations, and collaboration.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c14 c7">Great solutions do not come out fully formed, they are a combination of ideas, feedback, iterations, and collaboration.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c2">[EXERCISES]</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.4d34og8"><span class="c9 c7">Which comes first</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Do the thing right</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">Do the right thing</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.2s8eyo1"><span class="c9 c7">What is the problem with having too broad a HMW question?</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">It will not be something that you can create a solution for</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">You will be able to answer it too quickly</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">You are not able to make a good customer journey for it</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.17dp8vu"><span class="c9 c7">What does HMW stand for?</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">How might warriors</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">How might what</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">How might we</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">How maybe works</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.3rdcrjn"><span class="c9 c7">Choose the best HMW question&hellip;</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">HMW find a vehicle to drive us to school?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">HMW change the school system so attendance is not needed?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">HMW help students to attend school when they are not mobile?</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.26in1rg"><span class="c9 c7">Why do we say &#39;might&#39; in &quot;How Might We...?&quot; </span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">[Left out of the Finnish version and replaced with the question below]</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">because we don&#39;t know the answer</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">because &#39;might is right&#39; </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">because &#39;might&#39; leaves no options on the table</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">because &#39;might&#39; encourages many different ideas</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c28">[Finnish Question]</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.lnxbz9"><span class="c9 c7">True or False: We want to invite as many different ideas as possible during this part of the process?</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">True </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">False</span></p><hr><p class="c8 c15"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c24" id="h.35nkun2"><span class="c18 c7">Introduction to Ideation</span></h1><h2 class="c0" id="h.1ksv4uv"><span class="c3">Idea Creation</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s not about coming up with the &lsquo;right&rsquo; idea, it&rsquo;s about generating the broadest range of possibilities.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&mdash; Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford</span></p><h3 class="c10" id="h.44sinio"><span class="c6">What is and is not useful ideation</span></h3><p class="c8"><span class="c1">When we talk about ideation, we are not talking only about &lsquo;brainstorming&rsquo;. In fact, we are not really talking about brainstorming at all. There are many ways to come up with ideas and idea fragments that don&rsquo;t involve a traditional version of brainstorming (sitting around a table throwing out ideas in a group i.e. &ldquo;narrow group think&rdquo;). There are many reasons this process is unhelpful. Not least, because it favours certain personality types over others. Which means that not everyone has the opportunity to participate fully. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Full participation is what is necessary for proper ideation. The more people who feel comfortable sharing their ideas, the more ideas will be available to choose from and the more perspectives that will be represented. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">One of the most prevalent problems with group brainstorming is status. This means status within the organisation. The higher the &lsquo;rank&rsquo;, the more weight their idea can carry in some places. But ideation sessions need to balance having different levels of staff members there and a disregard for &lsquo;rank&rsquo; within the group. There are a number of ways to accomplish this. First, individual titles are to be left outside the door. Second, most idea-producing moments should be done in silence. Third, giving everyone the same colour paper and the same pens so ideas can not be attributed to a certain person. Fourth, specifically and openly stating equality to be the goal. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Ideation is not a free-for-all idea factory and there are no winners for idea generation. It is about creating a safe environment for everyone to participate at their fullest capacity. It is about creating a breadth and depth of ideas that could not be created otherwise. In this sense, ALL ideas are welcome (yup, even crazy ideas, unusable ideas, little ideas, big ideas). This is because you never know what will actually spark the idea that solves the solution. This is not about thinking outside the box, it is about understanding that there is no box.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">This is not about thinking outside the box, it is about understanding that there is no box.</span></p><h3 class="c10" id="h.2jxsxqh"><span class="c6">Rules for Ideation</span></h3><p class="c8"><span class="c1">With all of the excitement of an ideation session, it is important to remember that there are general rules that should be followed to make it fun and productive for everyone and to have the best possible idea generation outcomes. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c13 c2">[RULE FOR IDEATION VISUAL]</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c13">These 10 rules, in no particular order, are important because:</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Have an open mind</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- coming to an ideation session with an open mind is fundamental to the success of collaboration. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Be positive -</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;it requires positivity to take initial ideas and build on them. Negativity makes the process unenjoyable and unproductive.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">No electronic devices</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- electronic devices distract participants from being productive and present. It is important to not have phones and laptops in the room (and when online, the phone should be put away somewhere and notifications should be muted).</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Be engaged</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- being part of the group and fully participating is necessary for the atmosphere for everyone. Engaging with the process is how you create great outcomes.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Build on ideas</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- no great idea comes out fully formed. Ideas are built with other ideas and comments and feedback&hellip;and time. Allow your ideas to be taken and re-shaped to develop even better ideas.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Be present</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- being fully in the room during ideation is needed to be able to understand and build on others ideas. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Hierarchy-free </span><span class="c1">- leaving your title at the door and participating as an equal to everyone is vital to collaboration. Everyone has ideas, everyone wants and needs to be heard. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Persona 1st</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- remembering why you are there and who you are ideating for is really important. It doesn&rsquo;t matter so much if YOU like the idea but will this idea get your persona the outcome they are looking for?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">No bad ideas</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- there are no bad ideas. No crazy ideas. No silly ideas. When ideation starts, all ideas are welcome (and needed). Getting a laugh can help to ease any tension in the room and develop a more collaborative atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">No editing ideas </span><span class="c1">- when ideation starts, there is no editing needed. There is time later for more careful consideration of ideas and concepts. But the beginning of ideation is a time for ideas from everywhere!</span></p><h3 class="c10" id="h.z337ya"><span class="c6">Get better ideation</span></h3><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have a good brainstorm without setting it up right&mdash;having everyone feeling safe and heard.

It is the silent and more inclusive version of brainstorming. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Brainwriting is a technique for ideation where 5 or 10 minutes is set aside for no talking individual idea production. Each person is given a stack of sticky notes and a pen and any idea that pops into their mind, while thinking about the HMW question, is written (one at a time) on a sticky note. They can either collect beside them until the time is up and they stick them to the designated wall, window, whiteboard, wherever OR they can write and stick, write and stick. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">This method allows every person to have all their ideas considered. It can also allow them to do it fairly anonymously (if everyone has the same colour notes and pens). </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Another problem during idea generation is getting beyond the obvious ideas. Proper ideation is about digging deep and letting those first ideas out but then keeping going. This is why there are usually time pressure ideation exercises. This means that you do not have time to edit your ideas and you just let them out as they are. Editing your ideas before they go up on a wall or on a piece of paper is problematic as people tend to be less willing to take a risk on an idea when there is abundant time. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c2">[VISUAL]</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">One of these exercises is called Crazy Eights and this is where you come up with 8 ideas in 8 minutes (or, if you want, 10x10 or 6x6). It is up to the facilitator how many are used. However many are chosen, the first number refers to the number of ideas each participant has to come up with and the second number refers to the number of minutes you have to complete all those ideas. Usually these are done in picture form (that will be explained later to the group) but they could also be done with words. But usually you can fit more into a picture than you can into words in that short time. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Drawing is also a way of explaining an idea more clearly as words can get confusing as they mean different things to different people. Humans, as mentioned during the customer journey, are visual in many ways, and new ideas are a perfect way to use this form of storytelling.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">A great resource for ideation is &ldquo;</span><span class="c17 c7"><a class="c22" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gamestorming.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731120022547849&amp;usg=AOvVaw2E2g5sOvKwK1NhEWnwG_F9">Gamestorming: A toolkit for innovators, rule-breakers</a></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c2">[EXERCISES]</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.3j2qqm3"><span class="c7 c9">What are some of the negative outcomes from traditional brainstorming?</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">only the loudest voices get heard</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">popularity can bias decision-making</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">everyone has their say</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">status can affect decision-making</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.1y810tw"><span class="c9 c7">Which rules apply to an ideation session?</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">go to the session with a closed mind</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">be mindfully present in the room</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">all ideas are accepted</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">always have your phone on</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">build on other people&#39;s ideas</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">use hierarchy to influence decision-making</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.4i7ojhp"><span class="c9 c7">This is not about thinking outside the box, it is about understanding that&hellip;</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">we are all in the same box together.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">some people never get out of the box. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">this is a magic box where weird stuff happens.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">there is no box</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c8"><span>&nbsp; </span><hr></p><h1 class="c24" id="h.2xcytpi"><span class="c18 c7">Turning Ideas into Concepts</span></h1><h2 class="c0" id="h.1ci93xb"><span class="c3">Bringing the ideas together into concepts</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c1">You have been previously shown a couple of examples of how you can generate a large amount of ideas. This is necessary to see the range of possibilities and to make sure that everyone has been able to participate. This lesson is all about creating testable concepts out of the ideas that have been created. This is also where we will look at how to assess what might address the pains that your customer is having through the creation of value and &lsquo;gains&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">When you want to begin to organise the ideas, you need to go back to the same grouping activity that was explained in Chapter 2 - the Affinity Diagram. This grouping activity is about spotting patterns and themes and giving them names. The assumption is that all ideas are on some kind of sticky notes and placed on a wall or a window (or any large, flat surface). This will help to facilitate the notes being re-arranged into groups. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Physically being able to move the ideas into different groups is a must when it comes to sorting and creating concepts. It is possible that you may need to group the ideas more than once or that one idea will fit into more than one category. In this instance, you could write the same idea on another sticky note and place it in the second group. </span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.3whwml4"><span class="c9 c7">Who moves the sticky notes?</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">The simple answer to this question is that everyone does. This is a great silent activity which will allow people the time and space to think about what the ideas mean and what the &ldquo;red thread&rdquo; is in the different groups. There may be a time where there is a disagreement on the grouping and this should definitely be discussed. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">The whole process can also be done with discussion but this can be affected by the same issues as traditional brainstorming where the loud people (or the higher-ranked) have more say. So just be aware of that dynamic. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Once the groupings have been done, you can begin to conceptualise ideas and see which ideas are more preferable. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c2">[VISUAL]</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.2bn6wsx"><span class="c9 c7">Concept sketching</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Concept sketching is a Design Sprint technique that makes ideas tangible. This method allows for each person to design a concept that makes sense to them with the given information. There isn&rsquo;t any input from others during this and no one will even read the notes that are being made. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Concept sketching is a 4-part sketching method that Knapp highlights in his book which is all about going deeper into an idea. Looking a little further down the road to see how certain aspects will fit together. It makes the idea less abstract and more concrete. This allows everyone on the team to have more information when they will eventually pick a concept to move forward with. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">In this 4-part process, the first three parts are just supportive activities for the person creating the concept. None of this information or personal ideation will be shown to anyone. This exercise harnesses the great value of working alone together. You are free to sketch whatever you like. This is not about perfection or being a really good artist. It is about putting a visual on paper (yes, there can be words too&hellip;this isn&rsquo;t Pictionary&reg;). </span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.qsh70q"><span class="c9 c7">Step 1 - Note Taking (15 minutes)</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">This is just going back through the data that you have collected and writing the things that you feel are important to note. This can include any goal or outcome that your team has stated (maybe related to a KPI or something like that) but not all sessions will include this. It will also include the How Might We question that the team defined. You can fill up as many pages of blank A4 that you want with all the things that you feel are important. It is important to even write your thoughts down as you do this. What is popping into your mind at that moment, etc? What connecting thoughts are you having? It is important to remember that this is not a time for new ideas or information, it is just about writing down things that you already have. Refreshing your mind of what you have learned so far during the process. </span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.3as4poj"><span class="c9 c7">Step 2 - Ideas (20 mins)</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Step 2 is all about starting to form your own concepts and ideas out of your notes. You can circle the notes that strike you as something that you feel you want to visualise. Start practising your sketching skills. By putting the notes into a visual form, you are expanding how you look at them and how you understand and internalise them. Quickly sketch each of those that are circled. Maybe it is a scenario or a website screen. You don&rsquo;t need to have any clear ideas and you are not expected to create anything new. &nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.1pxezwc"><span class="c9 c7">Step 3 - Crazy 8s (1 minute for each box)</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">This exercise was explained in the previous lesson but in a slightly different way and for a slightly different purpose. It is used to generate different ideas whereas here it is being used to generate 8 different versions of the same idea. So choose your strongest idea that you started to visualise in Step 2 and use that idea for this exercise. This method will help you move beyond your first thought or idea. It could be different floor plans for a brick and mortar store or it could be different versions of the same website, etc. It is important to remember that this will feel uncomfortable and unfamiliar and this is normal. It is also good to remember that the &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; part of Crazy 8s is referring to the timeframe you have, not that your ideas should be crazy. This is the time where the ideas are more realistic and feasible.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">All three of these exercises are for your own eyes. You don&rsquo;t need to share these with anyone, they are just to help you get a clearer image in your mind of what you want to produce to share with the group. It is normal that it feels uncomfortable for many people to express their ideas in this visual way. It isn&rsquo;t something that is usually used, especially in a business setting. But it helps us to understand and communicate what we mean when describing things in words can get complicated. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">The final part of the 4 part sketching is the &ldquo;solution sketch&rdquo;. This is the part of the overall exercise where the work will be seen and analysed by others so it needs to be &ldquo;detailed, thought-out, and easy to understand.&rdquo;</span></p><h3 class="c10" id="h.49x2ik5"><span class="c6">The Solution Sketch (45 minutes)</span></h3><p class="c8"><span class="c1">This is where you can organise your thoughts into a clear 3-part story so your team can understand your idea. This is where you will be clear about how it will work. This sketch is done on 3 A4 papers. One for each panel of the concept. Using it like you would a presentation of 3 slides and organising your idea into a clear story.</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.2p2csry"><span class="c9 c7">5 Rules for Sketching</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Be self-explanatory</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- You will not have a chance to explain this to anyone, so it should be pretty clear.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Be anonymous</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- Don&rsquo;t put your name on your sketch (and all the same pens and paper should be used). The anonymity is vital to fairness when voting and deciding.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Ugly is OK</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- It can include stick people and boxes and words (nothing fancy) but remembering that it should be detailed, thoughtful, neat, and complete.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Words matter</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- If your screen has words on it, make sure that the space uses good words (not placeholder words or lines indicating words). Be thoughtful and use the space to really reflect what is important there. Annotations (extra explanations) can be used that clearly get your point understood.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Give it a catchy title</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- This helps to keep track of the solutions as everyone goes through them. After a certain amount, they may begin to blur together if they are all dealing with the same thing. So a catchy title is something that will help make it memorable and fun too.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">This is now a great time to collect up the ideas and one person can put them up on the wall. It is good to also have the How Might We question and any other desired aims/outcomes up on the wall above the ideas. Then it is time to take a longer break. Maybe lunch or the end of the day.</span></p><h2 class="c0" id="h.147n2zr"><span class="c3">Analysing Concepts</span></h2><h3 class="c10" id="h.3o7alnk"><span class="c6">Sharing and analysing concepts</span></h3><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Re-reading the How Might We question and any other desired aims/outcomes at the beginning of this helps to keep the direction in mind. Each person goes around and reads the ideas and starts thinking about what they feel is a good way to solve this.</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.23ckvvd"><span class="c9 c7">Voting</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">There are two ways you can begin to assess the different ideas. Just one can be used or it is possible to use both of them.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">One way is to use dot voting. Either by giving each team member a sheet of little sticky dots (or felt-tipped pens) that they can then apply or draw dots on various ideas that they feel address the problem that is being solved. This creates a kind of &lsquo;heat map&rsquo; by showing where most people feel is the best idea or ideas are. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">[STORYBOARD VISUAL] </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Another or additional way to analyse these ideas is to use the Impact/Effort Prioritisation Matrix introduced earlier. You can take these ideas (or parts of the ideas) and place them on the matrix. See which quadrant they fall into.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">[PRIORITISATION MATRIX]</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">After the voting has taken place, a review will take place of the parts of ideas that got the most votes. This is where there can be some discussion. Can good parts of different concepts be brought together? Is there one whole concept that people can agree to move forward on?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">This is where the decision about what you will prototype (Chapter 4) and test (Chapter 5) needs to be made. &nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.ihv636"><span class="c9 c7">Storyboarding your concept</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Once the concept is chosen (or pieces of various concepts are chosen), it is time to start working on creating a more robust concept. This means that it will need to be fully explored. The best way to do this is with a storyboard. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">With a storyboard you take the winning parts of the sketches and begin to piece them together in a similar fashion to the three-panel sketch that was done but in a more elaborate and cohesive way. The storyboard will be roughly 10-15 panels long and it will be in story form. This process can take a couple of hours to a whole afternoon. It is good to spend enough time on it that you are happy that a reasonable prototype will be able to be made from it. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c14 c7">&ldquo;The storyboard contained all of our best ideas, stuck together in a story that we could all understand and we hoped it would make sense to customers, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c14">Jake Knapp</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Drawing empty storyboard cells is how you start this exercise. If this is where you will build up the story of your new concept what you will use to design your testable prototype. Where do you want this customer journey to start? What are you wanting to get out of the test in the end? Is it about testing a new website or a new feature? Is it about a new physical product? A new delivery method? A new in-store experience? You need to create a journey and a storyboard that supports this process. What is created here will guide the actual prototype you will build.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c13 c2">[BLANK STORYBOARD VISUAL]</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Where possible, use the actual sketches that came from the earlier concept(s). Use those in the storyboard so you can see where those fit it and what details are missing around it. It is also very important to remember that this is not the time for new ideas. The task is to elaborate on this idea, not to create any new ones. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Your storyboard is about including headlines and notes and basic descriptors. Do not write at length about any of this. If it cannot be understood as a visual with minimal text, it isn&rsquo;t right. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Once this is completed, it is time to move to prototyping!</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c14 c7">If it cannot be understood as a visual with minimal text, it isn&rsquo;t right...yet.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c2">[EXERCISES]</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.32hioqz"><span class="c9 c7">Organising your ideas is done</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">after you have come up with a concept &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">before you have come up with a concept</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.1hmsyys"><span class="c9 c7">The upper right-hand quadrant of an Impact/Effort Prioritization Matrix is&hellip;</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">A quick win</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">A major project</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Maybe consider going</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Thankless or low value work</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.41mghml"><span class="c9 c7">Which idea is the most popular?</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1">The one that the boss contributes</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">The one with the most votes</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">The one with the best drawing</span></p><h4 class="c12" id="h.2grqrue"><span class="c9 c7">What is the last step in actually creating a concept to help solidify it?</span></h4><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c5">Storyboarding</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Voting</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Prioritising</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Ideating</span></p><hr><p class="c8 c15"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c24" id="h.vx1227"><span class="c18 c7">Making the Business Case</span></h1><h2 class="c25" id="h.3fwokq0"><span class="c3">What is the Business Model Canvas?</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c1">The original Business Model Canvas (BMC) is a strategic tool that was developed back in 2005 by Alexander Osterwalder (and released in 2008) to quickly and simply define and communicate the business model of an idea or concept. That being said, it is also used by teams to contemplate and define the way that their business idea or concept will make money, bring value to customers, and be a foundation for further development. One of the main features of the BMC is that it is one page. This feature is what helps to make it easy to understand and share with others. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Another feature of the BMC is that while it is split into different sections, it can also be split down the middle where the left side focuses on the internal business and the right side focuses on the segments related to external customers. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">The world has changed since 2008 and there are now some additional important issues that need to be considered when developing businesses. Primarily one of sustainability. The original BMC is a great template to adjust to fit changing needs. One of its original main purposes was to be simple enough to react to and reflect changes in the business environment and operations. So it is not a real stretch to incorporate something as important as sustainability. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">In order to reflect the modern requirements of business, that of Feasibility, Desirability, Viability, and Sustainability, this modified version of the BMC was created by &nbsp;Metropolia University of Applied Science. Referred to as the Metropolia Business Model Canvas (MBMC), the original prompts are mostly there but they have been supplemented by additional questions that help you ask the right kinds of questions to embed sustainability into your concept.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">[VISUAL MBMC]</span></p><h2 class="c25" id="h.1v1yuxt"><span class="c3">Why do you use the Business Model Canvas?</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Making money is an essential part of any company. It is also an essential part of most organisations, even if it isn&rsquo;t the main purpose for your organisation. The MBMC is a great way to quickly understand for internal teams or external stakeholders how your business makes money and what makes it different from other companies. Another important feature is that it is a simple enough tool that it can be iterated and changed at any time. The MBMC (or any other BMC) is never meant to be a static document - it is a constant &#39;work in progress&#39;. This document is also not meant to be used as an official document and will not enable you to get a business loan nor will it be required to set up a company.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">The MBMC is a simple one-page document used as an internal tool so that everyone understands what your company does, how you make money, who your company serves, how you reach them, what your special features are, and the simple financial incomings and outgoings of your business. With all this on one page, your team can more easily internalise the company and how it functions. Additionally, and very importantly, sustainability is best built into a business from the very beginning design phase. It is much harder to add sustainability into an existing business or concept at a later date after many decisions have been made.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">When taking a possibly untested concept or idea, you can use the MBMC to make sure that it makes business sense to pursue that idea or concept. There can be great concepts or ideas that actually don&rsquo;t work out because you cannot make the business case for them. In design, especially service design, this is ok. The business viability is as important as the desirability, the technological feasibility and the sustainability. This goes back to the Venn diagram shown to you in Chapter 1. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c2">[SUSTAINABILITY VENN DIAGRAM]</span></p><h3 class="c10" id="h.4f1mdlm"><span class="c6">How you use the Metropolia Business Model Canvas</span></h3><p class="c8"><span class="c1">The MBMC, because of how it is set up with different sides that focus on internal and external, is not necessarily filled in from left to right. It is almost guaranteed that you will NOT be able to fill in the whole thing in one sitting.

How could you leverage your level of sustainability to earn more? It is very possible that the company has multiple revenue streams. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Customer Segments</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;are the customer groupings that you are going to be serving. How do you define these segments? Can you divide your customers into different segments by their motivation for buying your product (this type of segmentation is better than traditional demographic segmentation) as they will speak a similar language and will better identify themselves in your marketing. Is sustainability important to them, can you increase your customer base by being more sustainable? </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7">Product End of Life</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is a section that is really important for those that are creating physical products. What happens to products that have reached their end of life is important to design at the beginning of the process to help individuals deal with this process. Has your product been designed with a view of upcycling/reusing/recycling? Is it easy to refurbish? Do you offer customers the possibility to return the product to you?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">As mentioned above, you will not fill this in from left to right, feel free to jump around to the sections that you already know.
