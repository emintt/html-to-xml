class="c24 doc-content"><h1 class="c21" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c8">Why We Pitch</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Pitching is something that all company owners need to do. It is a combination of marketing and personal performance. Sometimes the pitches will be small (one customer with one product) and sometimes the financing of your entire company will depend on this skill. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>Pitching is done to many different audiences; sometimes you will be pitching to investors, to attract your first real employee, or a co-founder for your early startup. On the other side of pitching, you may need to pitch an idea to a colleague you really want to start a new internal project with or convince your own CEO that your idea is worth the investment of your time and other resources. Daniel Pink discusses this using anecdotes, studies, and insights in his book</span><span class="c22"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.danpink.com/books/to-sell-is-human/%25C2%25A0&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731120085661966&amp;usg=AOvVaw2r9Cn1m0Ko6i0N4LhnWNp9">&nbsp;To Sell Is Human</a></span><span class="c3">. He explores how we are all &lsquo;working in sales&rsquo; in every part of our lives. He also has some templates for creating different kinds of pitches. All of these will help to hone this craft of pitching. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">We have all had a terrible experience of someone calling us or approaching us in a shopping mall wanting to try to sell us something. Most of the time, it is not something that we want or need. It feels uncomfortable because we just want them to leave us alone. These kinds of unsolicited selling interactions are a kind of pitch. These pitches are made to pretty &ldquo;cold customers&rdquo; - customers who have not necessarily shown an interest in what you are doing. They haven&rsquo;t done any research into what kind of client you might be, so the pitch they have is not tailored to you in any way. This is why it doesn&rsquo;t feel good. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11 c1">[VISUAL]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">But when you are selling ideas, either internally or externally, and you have done your homework, you are able to convey value properly. We pitch ideas and concepts in order to fill a need or to solve a, hopefully, real problem. If these have not been identified specifically, then it may be too early to pitch. </span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.30j0zll"><span class="c0">Pitching Internally vs Externally</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c34">Internally</span><span class="c3">, we are always looking at what we do to help the company be more of something - more profitable, more sustainable, more efficient, more impact, etc. It is usually stated in the strategy. So it is important to make that link between what the company says it wants to achieve and how your proposal will help to make that happen. In order for people to do this, they have to convince others of their own and their idea&rsquo;s ability to achieve the goal. This is much more of a collaborative approach to moving forward on an idea but make no mistake, this still requires you to be able to pitch. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c34">External</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;pitching is when you are pitching to someone who is not already attached to your company or your idea. This is much more of a transactional approach. You want something they have (money, influence, market access, expertise, etc) and you are trying to convince them to trade it for what you are offering. You need to make your offering interesting enough, valuable enough, for them to be willing to give up their resources.</span></p><h3 class="c15" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c31">This is why we pitch</span></h3><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c30" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c33 c1">Successful pitching</span></h2><h2 class="c30" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c1 c33">&nbsp;</span></h2><h4 class="c5" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c0">Successful pitching requires you to focus on 4 key ingredients:</span></h4><table class="c40"><tr class="c16"><td class="c7" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c3">Knowing your idea inside and out</span></p></td><td class="c7" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c3">Your pitch deck</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c16"><td class="c7" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c3">An impactful story</span></p></td><td class="c7" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c3">Your pitch delivery </span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c2"><span class="c29">&#65279;</span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c0">Knowing your idea inside and out</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Using this service design sprint process, by the time you are at the point where you are pitching, you should know the real problem, understand from your customer research why it is a problem and have tested one or more ways of fixing it. In other words, you should know this issue inside out. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">In addition to this, you should have looked into the surrounding market to see that there is a business case for it. If the organisation cannot sustain the cost of the solution, then it is not the right solution. In the service design process, solutions must serve both the needs of the customer and those of the business. There must be balance. </span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span class="c0">Stories that make a difference</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>Your customer research should have highlighted a story that you can tell of a real person and the effect that both the problem and the solution have on their lives.

Many people have many different names for the same or similar ideas.

While these might not actually be the only 10 slides someone actually needs, it is a really great illustration that 1) you do not need a lot of slides (nobody wants to get whiplash from your pitch deck), 2) it covers most of the slides you will need, and 3) he provides a nice template for everyone to use while showing that each slide should not contain a huge amount of text.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The pitch deck is not there for you to cram as much information on it as possible, it is about highlighting the most important information on the slide. Think of it like this, you don&rsquo;t want someone being able to replicate your work just from one pitch deck. You want highlights that you can build a story around. Because you are the only one who knows the story, this deck is yours!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">When walking onto a stage to pitch a new concept or business idea to anyone you want to convince to invest in your vision, you create a pitch deck that includes:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_3-0 start"><li class="c18 c35 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">NAME OF YOUR IDEA &amp; TAGLINE</span></li><li class="c6 c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">PROBLEM</span></li><li class="c6 c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">SOLUTION</span></li><li class="c6 c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">VALUE PROPOSITION</span></li><li class="c6 c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">BUSINESS MODEL</span></li><li class="c6 c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">LANDSCAPE</span></li><li class="c6 c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">TEAM</span></li><li class="c6 c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">CURRENT &amp; FUTURE STATUS </span></li><li class="c25 c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">ASK / CALL TO ACTION</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c3">It is important to note that there is a difference between your pitch deck and your pitch script. We will go through the pitch script in the next lesson. But here it is important to remember that while you are making the slides, they aren&rsquo;t necessarily entirely reflective of what you say. A good example of this is when you are introducing yourself. You will say the words but you will not have a slide with your name on it. This is why there is no introduction slide on the deck list above. So keeping this in mind, we will go slide-by-slide in the next section and will indicate where you can add your own intro (but it will not have a slide itself). There are also two possible places to add in the introduction, so you can choose one. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c41">[VISUAL]</span></p><h3 class="c15" id="h.2jxsxqh"><span class="c31">Slide-by-slide In Detail</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c3">With the limited amount of text that should be on each of the slides, you need to really hone your message.

People want to know what you will be solving (and essentially, why they should care). This is all about </span><span class="c10">who</span><span>&nbsp;is having the problem and </span><span class="c10">what</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;the problem is. This should be kept to short statements (basically bullet points) and elaborated on in the pitch script. This is a good place to put numbers to show that you have done your research. </span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c1">For example: X% of X is wasted, or X# of X segment group have faced this problem, etc. You can see some pitch decks from famous brands now if you go online and search for &ldquo;famous pitch deck examples&rdquo;.</span><span class="c1 c38"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slidebean.com/templates/uber-pitch-deck&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731120085672257&amp;usg=AOvVaw2y60_-UKYbNEasbXnEksNe">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c22"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slidebean.com/templates/uber-pitch-deck&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731120085672388&amp;usg=AOvVaw1TN3_xzCKcWpy9BZm9DbMz">Uber&rsquo;s pitch deck</a></span><span class="c1 c37">&nbsp;had two slides for the problem. You can see how they were able to really be brief with their words but still illustrate the problem they were solving.</span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.1y810tw"><span class="c0">SOLUTION </span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The solution slide comes right after the problem slide. First you describe the problem, then immediately follow up and let them know your solution. It is important that you make this ambitious but not unbelievable. Be realistic in your innovation. You can include a mock-up visual with a high-resolution photo and avoid using bullet points. It should be simple but impactful. </span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.4i7ojhp"><span class="c0">VALUE </span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c3">If the problem slide addresses the who and the what, this value slide is all about the why. It is always vital to show what the value of your product or service is. WHY should the investors care and what is in it for the customer? For the most part, there are three ways to show value: How it will make life better, it will save money, or it will save time. Or, hopefully, a combination of these. Make sure you highlight what is the value of your solution in a relatable and easy-to-understand way.</span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.2xcytpi"><span class="c0">BUSINESS MODEL</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Businesses are around to make money through creating value with their customers. But earning money can be done in many ways. It could be from saving money from being spent on unnecessary things as well as from generating new revenue. It can also be about saving the time of the employees who are now free to work on different or more projects. So your business model is about what the costs are of creating this service/product but also how much revenue (if any) it will generate. It is also about how you generate it. Including key metrics (and financial projections if required) is also important so the audience can understand what you will measure to track your success.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>There are so many business models out there. These were investigated by a team at the University of St Gallen, which turned into an innovation spin-off itself called BMI Labs. On their website, you are able to explore the identified</span><span class="c22"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://businessmodelnavigator.com/explore&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731120085673103&amp;usg=AOvVaw1R4-VwuhM_Kb348kMtpRfC">&nbsp;business model patterns</a></span><span class="c3">. </span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.1ci93xb"><span class="c0">LANDSCAPE</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The landscape slide is all about the environment that you will be operating in. It is the information that you have discovered when looking at understanding the market. This means the competition and the market behaviour should be investigated and understood. It also means that you need to talk about how you will fit into this market. How will you stand out from your competitors? Understanding that competitors don&rsquo;t just come from the same product but from the same outcome. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A simple example of this would be a candle company. A candle doesn&rsquo;t just compete with other candles. A candle can be defined as part of a relaxing process or wellness. It can also be defined as a reasonably-priced gift. So as a company, they are competing with others in the relaxing/wellness space or the reasonably-priced gift space. You need to really understand your customer and market space to be able to be a real competitor. Just as Uber doesn&rsquo;t just compete with other taxi companies, they are also competing with car ownership. Showing that you understand your 360 marketplace is important.</span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.3whwml4"><span class="c0">TEAM</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c3">You finally get to talk about the team that is working on solving this problem. Team is also one of the things that investors are really looking at when it comes to early investments. They need to have faith that you are committed to the problem, that each team member brings something important to the team, and that you can complement each other&rsquo;s skills. It is also important to recognise any skills that you currently lack. This will show that you understand where you need to invest in personnel. </span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.2bn6wsx"><span class="c0">CURRENT &amp; FUTURE STATUS</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c3">When looking at the current &amp; future status of your solution, explain where you are regarding testing, piloting, etc. and have a timeline and possibly a visual for the next version. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">If you are seeking some kind of investment, it is also important to mention how you will use whatever it is you are asking for (this can be primarily in what you say). Whether this is money, access to certain industries, or mentorship. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c17">(THIS IS &nbsp;YOUR SECOND CHANCE TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF - if you didn&#39;t earlier)</span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.qsh70q"><span class="c0">ASK/CALL TO ACTION</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The kind of pitch you are making, will determine how and what you are asking for. This is something that you need to really think about. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Internally, you may be asking for human resources to implement a new project or to allocate your time to this as a separate project. You may even want to advocate for an in-house incubator for you and others to explore ideas in a more innovative way. There are many things to pitch for. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">If it is for an investor or a co-founder, etc., you have to be specific in what you are looking for and reiterate what you are going to do with it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c17">Be precise, concise, and know your solution so you can answer most questions.</span></p><h4 class="c5 c26" id="h.3as4poj"><span class="c0"></span></h4><h4 class="c5" id="h.1pxezwc"><span class="c0">Template Resources</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Madlibs Template</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Pitch Canvas Template</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c41">[EXERCISES]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c17">What 3 types of pitches does this Lesson list:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c13">Elevator pitch</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c13">Short pitch</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Medium pitch</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c13">Long pitch</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Airplane pitch</span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.49x2ik5"><span class="c0">How many slides should a slide deck have?</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c3">16-20</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c13">10-14</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">1-9</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">20+</span></p><hr><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1 c27"></span></p><h1 class="c21" id="h.2p2csry"><span class="c8">Pitch Script &amp; Pitch Design</span></h1><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Now that the pitch deck is ready, I am sure that ideas have popped up about what will be said for each one. This is what we call the pitch script. Just like a script for a movie, it is a line-by-line description of what you will say during the entire pitch. Every word counts. The time pressure element of a pitch means that you have to script what you will say. Another way of saying this is that you are using speaker&rsquo;s notes. Except the plan is to memorise them. </span></p><h2 class="c39 c42" id="h.147n2zr"><span class="c33 c1">The Pitch Script</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Start with a stream of consciousness of what you would want to say for each slide. Then edit this. Writing everything you say will help you to internalise what it is that you need to say. It will also help you to regulate how long the pitch takes. If you have 5 minutes and it is taking you 7 minutes, then you know that something has to be taken out. It is easier to edit on paper than in your head. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Another thing to keep in mind is potential follow up comments or questions from those listening. These might come in the form of objections, why this idea or concept wouldn&#39;t work or in the form of further enquiries into numbers (market size, financials) or customers, etc. You can decide to add these slides to your deck at the end if you want (this shows that you have thought about these issues already and have something prepared) or you can just have answers prepared in your mind. Both work.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">When creating your main slides, you can create a list of must use words that you form into sentences to make sure that you are having maximum impact with your X number of minutes. Once you think that you have the right balance of impactful words and that you also balance reality with aspiration, it is time to start planning the pitch delivery.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11 c1">[VISUAL]</span></p><h2 class="c39" id="h.3o7alnk"><span class="c33 c1">The Pitch Delivery</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>Three words that will determine how you do pitching in the spotlight: </span><span class="c17">Practice, Practice, Practice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Much like a part in a movie or play, pitching on stage is about a convincing performance. It is about practising until you know it forwards and backwards. When you do this, you give yourself the best possible chance at the best possible outcome. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">You should be practicing it with a stopwatch and with a camera. But most importantly, with the stopwatch. Whatever situation you have created where you have a chance to pitch, will have a time limit. It might be 3 minutes, it might be 5 minutes, or it might be 10. And you should tailor your pitch to the parameters given to you. </span></p><h3 class="c15" id="h.23ckvvd"><span class="c31">Focus on speed and clarity</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The first run through can just be you sitting down reading the script and seeing how long that takes. If it is way too long, then do some edits and then try again. Remember to keep your voice calm and talk at a normal speed. There is a tendency to rush when we speak in front of a crowd. But this is why we practice. To get those &ldquo;first-time jitters&rdquo; out of the way. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Once you are fairly confident that your script represents the amount of time you have, it is good to practice with your slides and in a standing position. You will still need your stopwatch. See what happens when you now have to &lsquo;multi-task&rsquo;. From the time it takes, you will see where you need to adjust what you are doing or saying. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c17">Get out there and Pitch!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">[EXERCISES]</span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.ihv636"><span class="c0">What are the most important elements of your Pitch Delivery?</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c13">Answering a real need</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c13">Not going over the time limit you have</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Saying all the words perfectly as written</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c13">Presenting a coherent story</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Having all the answers in the moment</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c13">Anticipating and preparing for possible follow up questions</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c13">Knowing the basic numbers around your idea</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c17"></span></p><h4 class="c5" id="h.32hioqz"><span class="c0">After completing this Chapter you should be able to:</span></h4><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_1-0 start"><li class="c35 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>Arrange a simple pitch deck with enough information to present it to a group</span></li><li class="c6 c18 li-bullet-0"><span>Describe how pitching skills can be used equally as an entrepreneur or an employee</span></li><li class="c18 c25 li-bullet-0"><span>Paraphrase your concept into one or two sentences</span></li></ul></body></html>
