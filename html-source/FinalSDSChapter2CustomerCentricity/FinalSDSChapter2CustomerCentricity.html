class="c47 doc-content"><p class="c43 title" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c23 c26">Customer Centricity</span></p><h1 class="c36" id="h.30j0zll"><span class="c26 c13 c42">What is Customer Research?</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Customer research is something that is vital to do but that almost everyone says that they don&rsquo;t need to do because they &ldquo;already know their customers&rdquo;. As mentioned in Chapter 1, the delivery gap proved this wrong many years ago. The other issue is, of course, that customers&rsquo; needs and wants change with time, technology, and competition. So understanding what the landscape looks like on a regular basis is just good business practice.</span></p><h3 class="c38" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c20 c13">Types of data</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Quantitative data</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;comes from research that produces numerical data that can be used to give statistics, averages, comparisons, patterns, etc. When companies or news outlets (or anyone) talk about &ldquo;big data&rdquo;, they are referring to quantitative data that comes from quantitative research. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Qualitative data</span><span>&nbsp;comes from research that is generally non-numerical in nature such as interviews, diaries, photos, etc. It is also from the point of view of the individual providing information on their experience and their own context.</span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c21 c13">Different Phases in Research</span></h2><h3 class="c6" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c20 c13">Preparatory research</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Prep research is all about looking around and making sure that everyone understands the problem. It is about digging a little deeper internally about what everyone feels is going wrong. When using this internally, this can be a very good starting point for a project. Bringing people together - potentially from various functions/units/departments - will help to see where the biases are or where assumptions are being made. Understanding what is happening internally and how the problem is seen, is very important to moving forward and starting the process on a solid foundation. This is because it helps identify early on the different perspectives at play.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This could be done in a workshop format to discuss the problems people see or experience when dealing with this service or product.</span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c20 c13">Secondary research</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Secondary research involves the collection, synthesis, and analysis of existing information. During this research, there will be no research produced by anyone involved in the project. It might be that some people are conducting primary research while others are going through the secondary research, but those doing secondary research will not produce new information. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This research, which is sometimes also called &ldquo;desk research&rdquo; (because you should be able to access it from a desk), exists as both qualitative and quantitative research. These are industry reports, trend reports from agencies, journal articles, news articles, blog posts, internal customer data collected from around the organisation, academic research papers, conference abstracts, etc. There are a lot of places to search for data. A good place to start is, of course, your favourite search engine.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Desk research is done first so that a foundation of what information is already available is understood and can be built on, rather than repeated, when primary research is done. Don&rsquo;t forget to not only take in the information that you find but also to evaluate the level of confidence you have in the information. Evaluate the reliability of the producer of the information as well as the information itself. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">It is important and helpful for the rest of the team if summaries of findings can be documented and shared. These are great tools to refer back to when needed - when the process gets stuck or a little off track.</span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c20 c13">Primary research</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Primary research is the research that you conduct yourself (meaning specifically for your project by you or someone on your team). This research means that you will be producing new information through various means. Before we talk about different ways of conducting research, let&rsquo;s look a little closer at the most common types of primary research that are used in customer research. Here we will look at 3 different types of primary research.</span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span class="c20 c13">3 Types of Primary Research</span></h3><h4 class="c0" id="h.4d34og8"><span class="c25 c13"></span></h4><h4 class="c9" id="h.2s8eyo1"><span class="c25 c13">Participant approach</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This type of research means that the person that you are interviewing is fully aware that they are working together with you as a participant in research. </span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.17dp8vu"><span class="c25 c13">Self-ethnographic</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This type of research is where either the participant or the researcher takes control of the collection of information by self-recording thoughts, feelings, experiences through various means.</span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.3rdcrjn"><span class="c25 c13">Non-participant approach</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This type of research is when the person you are collecting information from doesn&rsquo;t know. This usually involves various kinds of observation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Knowing these 3 types of research for primary research, helps the person doing research to understand what the options are when faced with research method decisions.</span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.26in1rg"><span class="c21 c13">Useful research techniques for each type of research</span></h2><h4 class="c0" id="h.lnxbz9"><span class="c25 c13"></span></h4><h4 class="c9" id="h.35nkun2"><span class="c25 c13">Participant approach techniques</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The most common participant approach techniques are participant observations, in depth, 1-on-1 interviews, focus groups, and surveys.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Participant observation is a method that requires the participant to know that they are being observed. Depending on the focus of the research, what is being observed will change. These can be both digital or physical interactions. This can be watching a person navigate a website (or a new prototype), watching a certain process in their home or their lives (such as their morning routine or the commute to work), etc. So this technique can be the researcher sitting quietly in the corner, it can be the participant narrating what it is they are doing or thinking, it can include shadowing as the participant moves from place to place.</span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.1ksv4uv"><span class="c25 c13">Self-ethnographic techniques</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;self&rdquo; in self-ethnographic can refer to either the participant or the researcher. This means that the recording of experiences, feelings, accomplishments, and thoughts can be done by either when alone. Your participant can agree to keep a diary (whether written, photographic, digital, etc) and can give that to the researcher to then analyse. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Alternatively, the researcher can conduct an auto-ethnographic piece of research which means that they themselves go through whatever process needs researching and records these same points. There are also certain digital platforms that have been created specifically for self-ethnographic recording.</span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.44sinio"><span class="c25 c13">Non-participant techniques</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Non-participant, as mentioned earlier, refers to the fact that the participant does not know that they are participating in research. This can be as simple as counting the number of people that walk past a certain place at a specific time of day (trying to understand the foot traffic of a certain retail location for example). It can be observing where people go outside to smoke and if they are using the designated smoking area outside of a hospital for instance. You could even follow it up with some questions with those people after the observation (adding depth to your research by broadening it with participant research). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Using non-participant observations can help to confirm or reject what people have self-reported as how they do something. For example, if you interview a bunch of smokers in the hospital and they 100% say that they use the designated smoking area, then you wait and see later what percentage of people really do use it during a set amount of time. You can also use this observation time to see what their body language tells you. In the smoking scenario, are they actively trying to hide or mask their smoking, do they glance at the no smoking sign and purposefully ignore it? Or do they start smoking, see the sign and then move to the right place? All this is useful information.</span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.2jxsxqh"><span class="c21 c13">Assembling the research into insights</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Depending on whether this research was gathered by a team or by one person will really determine how you bring this all together. With a team, it will first be necessary to share the information collected and then decipher the insights. The insights may become clearer along the process for someone conducting the research by themselves. Either way, it needs to be shared in an understandable manner with your colleagues. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Analysing the data that you and your team have collected, you can start to see patterns in the kind of information that you uncovered. These patterns will start you on the path to seeing where you might want to dig deeper into your process, product or service for improvement.</span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.z337ya"><span class="c25 c13">Analysing the data through grouping</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c24"><a class="c31" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DXgr4931mwF8&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731118889460902&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YFvPeRpIdhmuXpxXka5jJ">Affinity diagramming</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(or grouping or clustering) is when you physically put related or similar information together to see the patterns. Start by putting each of the interesting pieces of information that you identified onto individual sticky notes and put them up on the wall. If there was a team of people doing the research (or parts of the research) have them do the same thing for the research they collected.

This research, as mentioned before, is also called &ldquo;desk research&rdquo; and it includes both qualitative and quantitative research elements. Included in desk research are any industry reports, trend reports from trusted sources, journal articles, news articles, blog posts, internal customer data collected from around the organisation, academic research papers, conference abstracts, etc. </span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.4i7ojhp"><span class="c20 c13">Building a Foundation</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Desk research is done first so that a foundation of readily available information is understood and can be built on, rather than repeated. Make sure that everyone on the team understands the important insights that have been identified. It is also important to evaluate the level of confidence you have in the information producer when you use these different sources.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Gather these materials through search engine searches, through contacting different units in your company (if you have any) to see what they have, ask around to see if anyone has done any primary research at your organisation that is related to your problem, etc. Read them and see what insights they offer and make sure that you note them down in a way that you can refer to them later if needed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You will see trends coming up, expectations on how things are progressing in certain sectors, you might even read interesting case studies of recently finished similar projects.</span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.2xcytpi"><span class="c20 c13">Iterative Process</span></h3><p class="c4"><span>One thing to remember is that desk research is something that will probably come up again in the process. At this very beginning stage of the process, we are looking for some general information as we have not really defined the real problem yet. And it is important to keep that in mind. Once the customer research has been done and the insights fully gathered and the problem is fully defined, you can then go back to desk research and see how others may have solved a similar problem. This is just more information for your team to add to all the other data you have. This does not mean that you copy them, what is right for their customers may not at all be right for yours.It is also important to look outside of your own industry to find solutions.

Along the way you will learn what you don&rsquo;t know or you will discover a nugget of something that will require you to quickly go back a few steps to the research part again. It is important to remember that although the double diamond is drawn as a linear process, it really isn&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">One-on-one interviewing is one of the most used techniques to gather information from your target group. Interviews will be a resource that you can always do more of if needed, and if you record them properly, you can go back through the data when needed. Conducting this kind of research is vital to the development of any useful service. So much of your future actions will depend on the outcome of what happens right at the beginning of your process. This information, when gathered at the beginning of the process, will provide data that you will return to many times to make sure that you are solving the right problem and designing something of real value for your customers or users. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>The first question you may have is &ldquo;how many do you need to do?&rdquo;. This, of course, is subjective. There is no one right answer. But it is definitely less than you would use for quantitative data collection. There are a few things to consider when thinking about conducting one-on-one interviews:</span></p><table class="c5"><tr class="c32"><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c22 c13">Who you interview</span></p></td><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c22 c13">Redundancy</span></p></td><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c13 c22">Approach</span></p></td><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c22 c13">Timing</span></p></td></tr></table><h4 class="c0" id="h.ihv636"><span class="c42 c13 c39 c37"></span></h4><h4 class="c9" id="h.32hioqz"><span class="c30 c37 c39">&#65279;</span><span class="c25 c13">Who you interview</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Make sure that you conduct interviews with the different types of people who will use your service (and maybe even a few that won&rsquo;t to find out why they won&rsquo;t for sure). When you are interviewing people, it can also include internal people who would deliver the service or those who currently deliver the service that you are reforming. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You will also consider things such as what their sources of income and access are to certain things. And by this I am just saying that you just need to be sensitive to what their life is like.</span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.1hmsyys"><span class="c25 c13">Approach</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c1">How will this interview be conducted? Will you do an online interview, using something like Zoom, Teams, or Meet, or will it be face-to-face? If face-to-face, where will it be done, at your office, at their place of residence, at the place where the service would usually take place? There are many things to consider when you think about the location. It is good practice in service design to either try to conduct the interview in the place where the service will/does take place or in a place where the interviewee is most comfortable. This level of comfort can allow them to be more open.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Additionally, it is really important for you to consider the situation of the people you will interview. It is not good practice to conduct research in a way that is contrary to the current situation of your potential interviewees. Like asking elderly people to do a Zoom interview (or in other methods, asking them to fill in an online survey) or expecting parents of infants to do interviews in places that are not stroller/pram accessible.</span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.41mghml"><span class="c25 c13">Timing</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Is the service that you are designing time-bound? Does it take place at a specific time of day (like a lunch-time yoga class or an in-house daycare)? Or all times of Day (a taxi service)? Ideally, you would be able to conduct the interviews at that specific time to really be able to immerse yourself in their world and to understand what the real needs and fears are. You can also discuss the issues that are currently on their minds at that time of day. It can be harder to conjure up authentic or difficult feelings when you are sitting in a nice cafe in the bright sunshine.</span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.2grqrue"><span class="c25 c13">Redundancy</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In qualitative research, as face-to-face interviews are, the concept of redundancy is also important in service design. This means that once you start hearing the same information repeated, you have basically reached a saturation point so that interviewing more people becomes somewhat redundant. This is when you know to stop. This may happen after 5 interviews, after 10 or more. This will be more of a determining factor than an arbitrary number.</span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.vx1227"><span class="c20 c13">Creating an interview guide</span></h3><p class="c4"><span>In order for you to conduct useful and comparable research from your interviews, it is important to create an</span><span class="c24"><a class="c31" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://servicedesigntools.org/tools/interview-guide&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731118889471087&amp;usg=AOvVaw2AJFqkkRVK-c1iAaOhl5zD">&nbsp;interview guide</a></span><span class="c1">. This is a script or plan that you intend to follow. An interview guide is helpful if you have split the interviews between different team members or just to keep you focused and on topic. Interviewing people can be a little difficult at first. When preparing your interview guide, you should give a lot of thought to your questions and potentially make it with others on your team to make sure that they are designed to get the information that you need.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The guide lists all the questions you want to ask (and there will of course be questions that you want to follow on with that aren&rsquo;t listed). And you may want to add those new questions to any future versions of the interview that you conduct. Adjusting your interview guide is perfectly fine. </span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.3fwokq0"><span class="c25 c13">Important guidelines for creating a good interview guide:</span></h4><ul class="c28 lst-kix_list_1-0 start"><li class="c40 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13">Have no expectations going into the interview</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- having no expectations means that you are there to listen and learn, not prove your own point.</span></li></ul><ul class="c28 lst-kix_list_5-0 start"><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13">Explain why you are there and why you are conducting the interview</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- this helps to build trust with the interviewee which is important for authenticity.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13">Ask permission to record if you want to do that </span><span class="c1">- some places require this by law but it is just good practice everywhere and also builds trust.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13">Avoid yes/no questions as much as possible</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- Sometimes they are necessary but in general, they add little value. </span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13">Avoid leading questions</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- these will not get you real answers, just the answers you want. This response is not very valuable.</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13">Ask about real experiences</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;- asking them to describe the last time they completed a task will give you insight into how they were feeling and thinking in that moment.</span></li><li class="c33 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13">Ask follow up questions when appropriate (even if they are not in your guide) </span><span class="c1">- going deeper is never really a bad thing.

This means that the person or function that you are observing can know you are there collecting information (participatory) or you can be observing them without their knowledge (non-participatory). This non-participatory kind sounds a little menacing, but it shouldn&#39;t. It is basically people-watching...but with a purpose. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you want to find out if having a &quot;smoking area&quot; somewhere outside a specific building is working as it should (for example at a hospital), a good way to find out how people act when they smoke outside of it is to observe their behaviour. Are they respecting the signs for not smoking in certain areas? Are there even convenient signs at all? Are people looking at them and then ignoring them or are they moving to the designated area after seeing them? How many people do this? You can set a time of 30 mins or 1 hour to observe their actions and record what you see in your notes. Are you noticing that those who seem to be patients (maybe they have hospital gowns on, have a hospital bracelet, or are using a wheelchair or other hospital equipment) obey or not obey the rules any differently than those who do not seem to be patients?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Write your observations in your notes. You can note down how many people in total used the &quot;service&quot;. You can go with some predefined things you want to look for. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you continue the hospital example, you might want to note:</span></p><ul class="c28 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c40 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">How many used the smoking area?</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Did they seem to be patients or not? </span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Did they seem to see the signage?</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Did they obey the signs?</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Were there any people who seemed confused?</span></li><li class="c33 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Were only people who had full mobility able to reach the designated smoking area?</span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Always make sure you leave room for there to be other, unexpected, observations.</span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.2u6wntf"><span class="c20 c13">Shadowing</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Shadowing is a technique that is similar to observation in that your role is to watch, record, and learn. It, by default, is also a qualitative research method as this is not something that can be done for a great number of people as it is time-consuming. But the depth of possible learning is great. As it is hard to change the way people do something or their behaviour, it can be important to really understand how they do certain things already to try to understand how you can later design your solution with actions that people are already comfortable taking. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>Just like interviews, shadowing requires you to prepare in advance. It is important to know what it is that you want to observe. Do you want to see how this person gets ready for work in the morning? Do you want to learn how they use a certain search engine or how they pick up their mail? Do you want to watch them order something online? &nbsp;Knowing what you want to observe and how you will observe them is vital to actually learning. It is also important to be able to accurately record what it is that is happening. You may need to prepare some kind of sheet where you can jot down predetermined instructions and how they were actually navigated. It might be a really good idea to use video to record the important interactions so that you aren&#39;t trying to remember what happened at some point in the future. For a more in-depth description of shadowing, you can check out the</span><span class="c24"><a class="c31" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/shadowing-in-user-research-do-you-see-what-they-see&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731118889473978&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ZGrzLnVvlLjwWawxT9Uma">&nbsp;Interaction Design website</a></span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You can observe this difficulty whenever a software changes its interface and people struggle to figure out where to find the commands or buttons they are looking for. Many people got so used to the way the Start Menu works in Microsoft Office products that there was a huge problem when they re-designed it to look and work differently. To the point where they brought it back.

It is not a specific person you know, nor is it based on one real person, it is based on the entire group of who you are trying to represent. It is normal that a company or organisation would have more than one persona created because their company or organisation would normally have more than one type of user or customer. A persona is needed for each of the groups that you serve.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Personas, rather than representing a specific demographic (as is used in other industries in the past (and present), are representations of certain behaviours or drivers/motivators your customers have. Traditional separators such as age, income, gender, postal code, etc are becoming obsolete for many customer personas. This is because, as services and products become more widespread and personalised, these differentiators become much less important and indicative of people&rsquo;s actions and intentions. Creating personas based on what motivates them can end up being much more meaningful in terms of outcomes. For both the customer and the company. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c18 c13">Personas must be created using the data and insights that you have collected during your research phase. At no point should you &quot;guess&quot; to create your persona(s).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The point of creating personas is to create empathy within the team to incentivise them to create better products, services and/or processes. One of the benefits of doing customer research at the beginning of any project is that it gives you access to the thoughts and feelings of so many people relevant to your business. It is with this data that you should begin to build your personas. You should be careful not to let assumptions and stereotypes creep into your personas. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If done correctly, and some demographic information is used in their creation (but not based on it), these personas can be more easily remembered and considered when it comes time to use them in relation to business cases.</span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.2lwamvv"><span class="c21 c13">How to define your personas</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In a workshop setting, you can co-create your personas with the rest of your team. A good time to do this is either at the same session where you present your research data or very soon afterwards. While talking about the people that you collected data on or with, you can begin to note down different aspects of the time you spent with/near them. How was their body language, what kinds of words did they say, what kind of quotes did they use and you noted, what did they say were their challenges or their motivations? There are so many ways to pull information about these people from the data you collected. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Once all of this personal information has been noted down on to sticky notes, it is now time to do another grouping exercise. This time you are looking for behaviours and drivers/motivators that are in common. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>A really great example of how to group people by their motivations is what Ben Ralph did in his 2017 article called</span><span class="c24"><a class="c31" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/beakerandflint/personas-74c4e1c12ee2&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731118889479440&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Njz-lGDozbfIMVQPaB8_k">&nbsp;Creating Personas</a></span><span class="c1">. He uses a simple example that is about a scenario for a bank. A bank has many, many different personas. So in the bank&rsquo;s case it would be useful to break it down based on the service that they want to use. This means that overall, there will be a lot of different personas but for each service there will just be 5 or 6 maybe. For the mortgage department, there are many people who want to buy homes. But that is too broad of a definition when it comes to who their customers are. Their personas will define the tone, the words, and the visuals that they use in their marketing. It also will help them decide who the customers are that they want to address and those that they may wish to not consider. This is why knowing your customers really well is important.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Once the grouping has been done, your job is to identify a &lsquo;red thread&rsquo; that unifies the people. This will help you to identify the axes for your &ldquo;persona matrix&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c22 c13">A persona matrix is a graph where you can plot two different motivators against each other. The labels that go on the matrix will be specific to the people that you are plotting.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">For example, designing services for refugees might require comparing their education level and their language proficiency.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Designing a product for travellers might require you to compare budget and risk level.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">For the mortgage department at the bank, this can be represented by how quickly they want to purchase a house and how much money they have access to.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Once you have identified the axes that you want to use (and this can take some testing and trying on different labels), then you can begin to start plotting the groups that you identified. See the graphic to see the outcome of this:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c7">[PERSONAS FOR A BANK VISUAL]</span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.111kx3o"><span class="c25 c13">Bank Example: 5 Identified Personas</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Planners: </span><span class="c1">This group who want to buy a house further in the future and who have a relatively high income</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">New Family</span><span class="c1">: This group wants to buy a house in the sooner rather than later but have a more middle income</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Investors:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This group wants a house pretty immediately and has a high income</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Savers</span><span class="c1">: This group wants to buy further into the future and is on a lower income</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Dreamers</span><span class="c1">: This group wants to buy a house pretty soon but is on a pretty low income</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">As you can see, with these five, the bank can now decide if they will actually use their resources to entice them as customers. With the information presented here, we could probably determine that Dreamers are not a category that they will pursue. The combination of short runway to investment and their lack of income, make them a risky group from the bank&rsquo;s perspective (it is also denoted in the the way the bank labelled this group &ldquo;Dreamers&rdquo;).From these personas, the bank can determine, from a business perspective, what is the best use of the limited money they have to invest in marketing and service provision and which personas they will target.</span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.3l18frh"><span class="c20 c13">Components of a Persona</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Once you have decided what possible personas exist in your space, and which ones that your company will pursue as customers, it is time to create an individual representative persona for each group.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You can do this by filling in a persona template. There are many persona templates out there, Google will show you them if you just look. You can also use the one that has been created for this course. A persona is a one page brief that is a representative, fictional person. This should include a name, an age, a profession, possibly a life situation (like parent, caring for elderly parents, employed, entrepreneur, etc), and a quote that is representative of their experience. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">It is also important information about their goals, challenges, motivations, values, needs, interests, and preferences. In the provided Persona Template there are prompts in each section so that you know what you should include.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c23 c22 c7">[PERSONA VISUAL]</span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.206ipza"><span class="c20 c13">Using a persona</span></h3><p class="c10 c15"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.4k668n3"><span class="c25 c13">The value of a persona</span></h4><ul class="c28 lst-kix_list_3-0 start"><li class="c40 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">You can see problems and goals of customers very quickly</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">It gets different colleagues on the same page quickly as to who they serve and what they want</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">It helps to embed empathy as a starting point in any product/service development through deep customer understanding</span></li><li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">It can help you identify who you want and who you don&rsquo;t want as customers (sometimes certain groups aren&rsquo;t quite ready for your solution or helping get them there would be too costly)</span></li><li class="c33 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">It helps you to identify the words, phrases, and tone needed to speak to your customers via marketing, sales, and support.</span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span class="c1">But one of the most important uses for a persona is for keeping the customer at the centre of your decision making. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">When you have this person relying on you to help them reach their goals and to help lessen their frustrations and pain points, and you keep coming back to them during the process, your product or service will get better. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">During internal discussions, your persona(s) should have a seat at the table, referring to them by name when discussing features and processes.</span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.2zbgiuw"><span class="c20 c13">Template Resources</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Persona Template</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c7">[EXERCISES]</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">True or False, &nbsp;a persona is a description of a real person that you know.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c12">False</span></p><p class="c4"><span>True</span><hr></p><h1 class="c36" id="h.1egqt2p"><span class="c23 c26">Building a Customer Journey</span></h1><h2 class="c17" id="h.3ygebqi"><span class="c21 c13">What is a customer journey map?</span></h2><p class="c4"><span>Customer journey maps are not what one person in the team thinks happens or even what a team of &quot;experts&quot; thinks happens. </span><span class="c13 c18">A customer journey map is built entirely from the experience and perspective of the customer. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Journey mapping is a process where you combine two basic human communication tools - storytelling and visualisation. Both storytelling and visualisation help people understand certain concepts better. They also help to build empathy. This kind of mapping is a way of seeing your service from the user&rsquo;s perspective. It allows you to use your persona to walk through their journey to gain insights into pain points (where your service is not living up to its promise) and to what is going right. It is also a way to see a bigger picture than just the part of the experience that your everyday day work may hide. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Journey maps also visualise the experience over time. The experience that a user or customer has is not a single moment event. You can see that with return policies. If it was a single moment event, you would buy the product or service and that would be it. But everyone understands that it takes time for an experience to unfold. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In the eyes of the user, your company or organisation is just one service provider (even if you outsource various functions or collaborate with other companies). In the mind of the user, a service, no matter who is responsible for it in the back end, expects it to be connected and seamless. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c18 c13">The most important thing to remember about a Customer Journey Map is that it is based on the customer research that you do. </span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.2dlolyb"><span class="c21 c13">Components of a basic customer journey map</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you search online for a journey map, you will find many different variations. It can be daunting. But when creating a simple customer journey map, there are just five rows (or lanes as some call them) of information.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>We have already talked about the very top row of the journey map: the point in the timeline of the map. But what other lanes are on a map? For a basic functional map that will teach you something, it is important to have at least these 4 rows of information: </span></p><table class="c5"><tr class="c29"><td class="c14" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c18 c13">Customer actions</span></p></td><td class="c16" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c1">are defined as what the customer is actually doing at that moment in the sequence.

The emotional journey is a vital part of the journey to record. </span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c4"><span class="c30 c7 c37">&#65279;[JOURNEY MAP VISUAL]</span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.sqyw64"><span class="c21 c13">What kind of map is needed?</span></h2><p class="c4"><span>There are 2 decisions that need to be made when starting to create a journey map:</span></p><table class="c5"><tr class="c32"><td class="c41" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Time</span></p></td><td class="c41" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Level of Detail</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c4"><span class="c30">&#65279;The time perspective means whether you are creating a current status or desired future map</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">AND </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c30">The level of detail you will use - broad overview level or specific detail level&#65279;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You can do a high level analysis where you go through a very broad overview of your service within the organisation right down to a level of analysis that goes through the login process. You need to define what you are mapping.</span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.3cqmetx"><span class="c25 c13">Current Status and/or Future Desired State</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In the first instance, time, we mentioned that there are 2 time perspectives. It can be a map reflecting how things are currently done or it can be a map of a desired future. Often it is good to have both so that everyone truly understands the starting point. One hindrance to improving a service (or product) experience is not knowing how the experience is currently going, and therefore, not knowing where to go. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The desired future journey map will help you to identify where your improvements need to be targeted so that your desired user experience will be met. It is the same as picking an outcome or a destination and working your way back to see what needs to happen (and change) between now and the end date for your goal to be achieved.</span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.1rvwp1q"><span class="c25 c13">Levels of Detail</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The second decision that has to be made is the level of detail you are going to use to create your journey map. The highest level of journey map is where you map the Before, During, and After actions in a broad manner on a single map. As you will see from the illustrated maps below, each subsequent level of map digs deeper into a certain section of your customer&rsquo;s experience. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c23 c22 c7">[LEVELS OF DETAIL VISUAL]</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">In this Journey Map Detail Levels example, you can see how each next level digs deeper into the previous one. As a team, you need to decide which level of detail you wish to look at. If you want to journey map what the decision process is to get to the point where a customer will buy your product/service, then you are looking at a level 2. If you want to map how they start using your service, that is probably a level 3. If you want to look in minute detail at the email flow (the number or messages/what the messages say/how instructions are given, etc.) at the point of when a person first logs into your service, that is a level 4. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">A journey map can be thought of just like a geographical map, which, depending on how zoomed in you are, will show you a place that will take you 24 hours to get to by plane, 5 hours to get to in a car, or 15 minutes by walking. Your detail level will also determine the time length of the experience. Is it, for example, a whole week at level one, a day or two at level 2, an hour at level 3 or, just a few minutes at level 4?</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">So agree on the level and the perspective of the map and you can begin to look at filling a map of your own in.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c18 c13">EXAMPLE</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In the example, Sara&rsquo;s discovery journey of our service, you can see how this top level takes a very broad view of the journey. The example is specifically vague regarding what service it is dealing with just because it is an example. When you look at this, you can decide that you want to take a closer look at the areas that are yellow or red in the experience section. Then you can create a map for that specific section to see where the problems might be.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c7">&nbsp;[FILLED JOURNEY MAP VISUAL]</span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.4bvk7pj"><span class="c20 c13">Using a customer journey map</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The beginning of this process started with a lot of research. This means that your persona is based on research and the customer journey map that you create can also be based on research. It is so important to make sure that the journey is based on research and not guessing because this is where you will begin to look at where and how you can make the experience of your customer better. If this is done on an assumption based map, then you are essentially only guessing. And basing changes on how you do something or how you produce something on a guess, is not going to be a great strategy in the short or long term. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">As mentioned, the journey map should be a journey that represents a single persona that you have created. Each persona type will have a different journey. It is also a good idea to create these so that you can understand how their journeys are different. This will show you where you need to supplement different parts of your experience or where you need to make new paths or possibilities for them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The persona and the journey map are intertwined in a way that will help guide your company to a greater understanding of who your customers are, what they need, and how they use your products and services. They also help with the empathy needed to really create value for them and to want to create real value for them. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>A research-based, persona-led journey map, it must be strongly emphasised, is the tool needed to begin to redesign your experience (at whatever level is needed). It is neither an outcome nor a piece of art (although it will feel like a piece of art with all the hard work that goes into it). As contradictory as it is, a journey map is both a snapshot in time and something that is always changing. As Mark Stickdorn, who is, among other things, a co-author of two foundational service design books:</span><span class="c24"><a class="c31" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.service-design-network.org/books-and-reports/this-is-service-design-thinking&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731118889489113&amp;usg=AOvVaw3NpWfOKUbxy7RyZRI3yRtZ">&nbsp;This is Service Design Thinking</a></span><span>&nbsp;(2012) and</span><span class="c24"><a class="c31" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thisisservicedesigndoing.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731118889489413&amp;usg=AOvVaw1P2nL-QDmfAyCGxCZXllkZ">&nbsp;This is Service Design Doing</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(2018), says &quot;Customer Journey Maps are not a deliverable!&quot;. This means that the point of the map is not to have the map. It is to use the map as a starting point for creating your deliverables (improved services, new services, better customer experiences, etc.). A customer journey map is where the hard work begins to design better services because now you know where there are some pain points.</span></p><h2 class="c17" id="h.2r0uhxc"><span class="c21 c13">Creating a Journey Map</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Physically creating a journey map can be as simple as taking a blank piece of paper and drawing the different necessary sections on it. It needn&#39;t be pretty or complicated. It just needs to be understandable by those who will look at it. A great way to create a first version of a customer journey map is a large piece of paper (maybe from a flip chart or a roll of paper) and sticky notes. The sticky notes are important because they are movable. Nobody ever gets a journey map right in the first attempt. The ability to move steps in the process to the left and right is essential as more information becomes clear. You may have a cross-unit group that reminds people of forgotten steps or misunderstood processes. This is normal and expected. By starting in this agile and temporary way, you allow more information to be added or removed as needed. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The templates provided can be used, maybe you can print them on A3 or poster paper if you wish but they are just a guideline.
