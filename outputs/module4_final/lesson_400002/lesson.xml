        <title>Testing Prototypes &amp;amp; Iteration</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Testing Your Prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most important thing you can do with your prototype is to show it to people. The right prototype type should be used to get the most out of talking to your audience. It is important to keep in mind that when you are gathering feedback on your prototype, you want it to be as unbiased and as honest as possible. Here are a few things that you need to keep in mind when testing your prototype:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoiding a very polished prototype will generally help people be less shy about giving you negative feedback. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If it is too polished, they may feel like you have invested a lot of time and effort into it. This is not what you want. Sometimes less polished will get you better quality feedback.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Take a step back from the prototype. This means maybe speaking in more neutral terms about the creation of the prototype (instead of “we have created this prototype/product/service, replace that with “this prototype/product/service has been designed/created…”). People don’t want to hurt your feelings if they think that this is something that you personally have created&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Asking open questions when wanting to know how easy/difficult they found it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be specific of the function/action you want them to try to complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;You don’t need to have a lot of testing sessions to get the majority of the feedback.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The best way to test a prototype is always with the people who would be using the service but to be honest, that isn’t always possible. If you can’t get a few real users, then second best is to have testers who have no idea about what you are doing. There is no point in having someone who knows more about the service than an average user would. The amount of value that brings is minimal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[VISUAL]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Preparing for Testing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Low fidelity digital prototypes (either paper mockups or digital mockups) are easy to take to users. Don’t be embarrassed by their lack of a polished look. Research has shown that users are more likely to suggest useful changes to something that they know is still a work in progress. In other words, if it looks too polished, they are less likely to be honest as they see all the hard work that has gone into it and they don’t want to disappoint you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just like when you created an interview guide for doing your customer interviews, you can create the same kind of document at the prototyping stage. First you should create the question guide so that the prototype testing is consistent and comparable. Then you should create a form to collect the answers to the questions. Decide what you want to test and decide what outcomes you are looking for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who tests it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are two sides to testing your prototype. The testers and the users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The testers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;should be the people who are involved in creation of the prototype. It might be required that you need someone who is a specialist in digital services but both people should be involved. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The users &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;should be representatives of the actual users and possibly the providers. It needs to make sense and be easy to use for both sides of the service. If it is a physical service, then testing it with both perspectives - the provider and the user - is important but if it is more of a one-sided digital service, then just testing it with the end user, that is ok. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;How many tests?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In terms of numbers of tests, you can limit these to 5 or so for each round. There is no need to do an immense amount of testing to get an understanding of most of the issues. This is very similar to the rules that apply when doing in-depth customer research that we looked at in Chapter 2. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do you find the users who will test your prototype? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is an interesting question because there are several ways to obtain people to test your prototypes. It is important to understand that you should set these up before your prototype is ready to avoid wasting time. You will need to set a deadline for the prototype to be ready and then make sure that your users have an appointment for a test before that deadline. Another thing that you need to consider is whether you will provide the user with a reward for taking part. These can be vouchers for going to the cinema, gift cards for local stores, or something like an online voucher of some kind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First, you can ask real company users of your service. Maybe a general email can be sent out asking for those interested in being testers on the next project - include in this email whether there will be some kind of reward for their time and effort. Second, you can put a request in different facebook groups that have your user persona as members (make sure you ask permission from the group owner if it is not you), this also goes for other social media sites. The last one mentioned here is to spend some money on social media advertising. This is useful because you can target who sees the ad which should replicate your persona as much as possible.    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Documenting your tests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along with the interview guide itself, you should create a form of some kind to record the answers. Maybe you can create a scoring system with linear scales on how easily different actions were performed along with notes. It is probably most important to make sure that the notes from the session are good. This may require that there is more than just the person testing the prototype with the user. A good idea, when possible, is that there is another person there to take accurate notes about how the process went.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A standardised record sheet is great to use if multiple people are conducting the tests. This makes sure that the information that is gathered is understandable by others if for some reason the interviewer cannot present the feedback. It is also good to have this in a common form when gathering the insights from the information and in using those insights to create changes to the prototype. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using the Feedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Having created the prototype and conducted the tests, you now have more information about your product/service from actual users. Going back to how we dealt with information earlier in the process, you can stick the important points onto sticky notes and onto a wall. This can be done in two ways, either each person who conducted interviews can do this by themselves in front of the group while telling the story of each user, or the interviewer can tell the story and then the people listening can write sticky notes and put them up when they hear interesting points. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is also important to collect the data points that you're specifically tested to see how many people found it easy, difficult, or confusing to perform the tasks that you asked them to do. These exercises will help you to identify the insights that came from the interviews. These insights will inform how you iterate your concept further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Iterating your concept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using the identified insights, identify the parts of the product or service that you will iterate. Using these insights, you will decide if you will also upgrade the overall look and feel of the prototype for the next round of prototype testing. This may or may not be useful or necessary, you need to decide this. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An example of this upgrade could be seen as going from a paper prototype for the first round to a hybrid or digital prototype for the second round. With more refined processes, it may be worth investing more effort into the look and feel of the prototype as you get closer to the finished product. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[ITERATION VISUAL]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you have iterated your prototype, it is probably time to organise a few more tests to make sure that what you did actually fixed the problem(s). This process goes on until you are happy that enough people will be able to use your service or product without much issue. Remember, if many people have issues, this will ramp up your costs in customer service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Always be ready to follow the evidence- Love the Problem, Not the Solution!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;To help people give more unbiased feedback you should:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;not show a very polished prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;tell them what to say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;speak in neutral terms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;be specific on the actions you want them to perform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ask open questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;tell them how hard you worked on it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you need to initially test your prototype, how many people should you test it with?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;20+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;5-10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;50+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just your mother&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;After completing this Chapter you should be able to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Demonstrate multiple methods to prototype a service or product &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Describe why prototyping is a valuable way to develop and test concepts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experiment with low-fidelity prototypes to iterate and increasingly improve during the testing phase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>
