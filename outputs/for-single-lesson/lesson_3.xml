        <title>Turning Ideas into Concepts</title>
        <contents>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;[Section 1] Ideas to Concepts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bringing the ideas together into concepts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The end of Lesson 2 had a couple of examples of how you can generate a large amount of ideas. This is necessary to see the range of possibilities and to make sure that everyone has been able to participate. This lesson is all about creating testable concepts out of the ideas that have been created. This is also where we will look at how to assess what might address the pains that your customer is having through the creation of value and ‘gains’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you want to begin to organise the ideas, you need to go back to the same grouping activity that was explained in Module 2 Lesson 1. This grouping activity is about spotting patterns and themes and giving them names. The assumption is that all ideas are on some kind of sticky notes and placed on a wall or a window (or any large, flat surface). This will help to facilitate the notes being re-arranged into groups.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Physically being able to move the ideas into different groups is a must when it comes to sorting and creating concepts. It is possible that you may need to group the ideas more than once or that one idea will fit into more than one category. In this instance, you could write the same idea on another sticky note and place it in the second group. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who moves the sticky notes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The simple answer to this question is that everyone does. This is a great silent activity which will allow people the time and space to think about what the ideas mean and what the “red thread” is in the different groups. There may be a time where there is a disagreement on the grouping and this should definitely be discussed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The whole process can also be done with discussion but this can be affected by the same issues as traditional brainstorming where the loud people (or the higher-ranked) have more say. So just be aware of that dynamic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once the groupings have been done, you can begin to conceptualise ideas and see which ideas are more preferable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Concept sketching&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Concept sketching is a Design Sprint technique that makes ideas tangible. This method allows for each person to design a concept that makes sense to them with the given information. There isn’t any input from others during this and no one will even read the notes that are being made. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Concept sketching is a 4-part sketching method that Knapp highlights in his book which is all about going deeper into an idea. Looking a little further down the road to see how certain aspects will fit together. It makes the idea less abstract and more concrete. This allows everyone on the team to have more information when they will eventually pick a concept to move forward with. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this 4-part process, the first three parts are just supportive activities for the person creating the concept. None of this information or personal ideation will be shown to anyone. This exercise harnesses the great value of working alone together. You are free to sketch whatever you like. This is not about perfection or being a really good artist. It is about putting a visual on paper (yes, there can be words too…this isn’t Pictionary®). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 1 - Note Taking (15 minutes)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is just going back through the data that you have collected and writing the things that you feel are important to note. This can include any goal or outcome that your team has stated (maybe related to a KPI or something like that) but not all sessions will include this. It will also include the How Might We question that the team defined. You can fill up as many pages of blank A4 that you want with all the things that you feel are important. It is important to even write your thoughts down as you do this. What is popping into your mind at that moment, etc? What connecting thoughts are you having? It is important to remember that this is not a time for new ideas or information, it is just about writing down things that you already have. Refreshing your mind of what you have learned so far during the process. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 2 - Ideas (20 mins)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 2 is all about starting to form your own concepts and ideas out of your notes. You can circle the notes that strike you as something that you feel you want to visualise. Start practising your sketching skills. By putting the notes into a visual form, you are expanding how you look at them and how you understand and internalise them. Quickly sketch each of those that are circled. Maybe it is a scenario or a website screen. You don’t need to have any clear ideas and you are not expected to create anything new.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 3 - Crazy 8s (1 minute for each box)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This exercise was explained in Lesson 2 but in a slightly different way and for a slightly different purpose. In Lesson 2, it is used to generate different ideas whereas here it is being used to generate 8 different versions of the same idea. So choose your strongest idea that you started to visualise in Step 2 and use that idea for this exercise. This method will help you move beyond your first thought or idea. It could be different floor plans for a brick and mortar store or it could be different versions of the same website, etc. It is important to remember that this will feel uncomfortable and unfamiliar and this is normal. It is also good to remember that the “crazy” part of Crazy 8s is referring to the timeframe you have, not that your ideas should be crazy. This is the time where the ideas are more realistic and feasible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All three of these exercises are for your own eyes. You don’t need to share these with anyone, they are just to help you get a clearer image in your mind of what you want to produce to share with the group. It is normal that it feels uncomfortable for many people to express their ideas in this visual way. It isn’t something that is usually used, especially in a business setting. But it helps us to understand and communicate what we mean when describing things in words can get complicated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The final part of the 4 part sketching is the “solution sketch”. This is the part of the overall exercise where the work will be seen and analysed by others so it needs to be “detailed, thought-out, and easy to understand.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Solution Sketch (45 minutes)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is where you can organise your thoughts into a clear 3-part story so your team can understand your idea. This is where you will be clear about how it will work. This sketch is done on 3 A4 papers. One for each panel of the concept. Using it like you would a presentation of 3 slides and organising your idea into a clear story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Knapp points out that, overall, it should follow 5 rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be self-explanatory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; - You will not have a chance to explain this to anyone, so it should be pretty clear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be anonymous&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; - Don’t put your name on your sketch (and all the same pens and paper should be used). The anonymity is vital to fairness when voting and deciding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ugly is OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; - It can include stick people and boxes and words (nothing fancy) but remembering that it should be detailed, thoughtful, neat, and complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Words matter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; - If your screen has words on it, make sure that the space uses good words (not placeholder words or lines indicating words). Be thoughtful and use the space to really reflect what is important there. Annotations (extra explanations) can be used that clearly get your point understood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Give it a catchy title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; - This helps to keep track of the solutions as everyone goes through them. After a certain amount, they may begin to blur together if they are all dealing with the same thing. So a catchy title is something that will help make it memorable and fun too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is now a great time to collect up the ideas and one person can put them up on the wall. It is good to also have the How Might We question and any other desired aims/outcomes up on the wall above the ideas. Then it is time to take a longer break. Maybe lunch or the end of the day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;[Section 2] Analysing Concepts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sharing and analysing concepts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Re-reading the How Might We question and any other desired aims/outcomes at the beginning of this helps to keep the direction in mind. Each person goes around and reads the ideas and starts thinking about what they feel is a good way to solve this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Voting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are two ways you can begin to assess the different ideas. Just one can be used or it is possible to use both of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One way is to use dot voting. Either by giving each team member a sheet of little sticky dots (or felt-tipped pens) that they can then apply or draw dots on various ideas that they feel address the problem that is being solved. This creates a kind of ‘heat map’ by showing where most people feel is the best idea or ideas are. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="Dot voting Sprint" src="images/image1.jpg" title=""/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another or additional way to analyse these ideas is to use the Impact/Effort Prioritisation Matrix introduced earlier. You can take these ideas (or parts of the ideas) and place them on the matrix. See which quadrant they fall into.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="Prioritisation matrix" src="images/image8.jpg" title=""/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After the voting has taken place, a review will take place of the parts of ideas that got the most votes. This is where there can be some discussion. Can good parts of different concepts be brought together? Is there one whole concept that people can agree to move forward on?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is where the decision about what you will prototype (Module 4) and test (Module 5). So a decision needs to be made.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Storyboarding your concept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once the concept is chosen (or pieces of various concepts are chosen), it is time to start working on creating a more robust concept. This means that it will need to be fully explored. The best way to do this is with a storyboard. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With a storyboard you take the winning parts of the sketches and begin to piece them together in a similar fashion to the three-panel sketch that was done but in a more elaborate and cohesive way. The storyboard will be roughly 10-15 panels long and it will be in story form. This process can take a couple of hours to a whole afternoon. It is good to spend enough time on it that you are happy that a reasonable prototype will be able to be made from it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The storyboard contained all of our best ideas, stuck together in a story that we could all understand and we hoped it would make sense to customers, too.” Jake Knapp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Drawing empty storyboard cells is how you start this exercise. If this is where you will build up the story of your new concept what you will use to design your testable prototype. Where do you want this customer journey to start? What are you wanting to get out of the test in the end? Is it about testing a new website or a new feature? Is it about a new physical product? A new delivery method? A new in-store experience? You need to create a journey and a storyboard that supports this process. What is created here will guide the actual prototype you will build.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="Storyboarding template" src="images/image5.jpg" title=""/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Where possible, use the actual sketches that came from the earlier concept(s). Use those in the storyboard so you can see where those fit it and what details are missing around it. It is also very important to remember that this is not the time for new ideas. The task is to elaborate on this idea, not to create any new ones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your storyboard is about including headlines and notes and basic descriptors. Do not write at length about any of this. If it cannot be understood as a visual with minimal text, it isn’t right. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once this is completed, it is time to move to prototyping!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;[Section 3] Making the Business Case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the Business Model Canvas?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The original Business Model Canvas (BMC) is a strategic tool that was developed back in 2005 by Alexander Osterwalder (and released in 2008) to quickly and simply define and communicate the business model of an idea or concept. That being said, it is also used by teams to contemplate and define the way that their business idea or concept will make money, bring value to customers, and be a foundation for further development. One of the main features of the BMC is that it is one page. This feature is what helps to make it easy to understand and share with others. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another feature of the BMC is that while it is split into different sections, it can also be split down the middle where the left side focuses on the internal business and the right side focuses on the segments related to external customers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The world has changed since 2008 and there are now some additional important issues that need to be considered when developing businesses. Primarily one of sustainability. The original BMC is a great template to adjust to fit changing needs. One of its original main purposes was to be simple enough to react to and reflect changes in the business environment and operations. So it is not a real stretch to ask it to incorporate something as important as sustainability.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to reflect the modern requirements of business, that of Feasibility, Desirability, Viability, and Sustainability, this modified version of the BMC has been created below. As you can see, one of the great original features, the questions that prompt you to research and record the needed information, are still being used. This helps those who are not entirely familiar with the BMC to understand what needs to be in that column and nudge you in the right direction.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/image4.png" title=""/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why do you use the Business Model Canvas?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Making money is an essential part of any company. It is also an essential part of most organisations, even if it isn’t the main purpose for your organisation. The BMC is a great way to quickly understand for internal teams or external stakeholders how your business makes money and what makes it different from other companies. Another important feature is that it is a simple enough tool that it can be iterated and changed at any time. A BMC is never meant to be a static document and it is not an official document either. This document will not enable you to get a business loan nor will it be required to set up a company. ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A BMC is an internal tool so that everyone understands what your company does, how you make money, who your company serves, how you reach them, what your special features are, and the simple financial incomings and outgoings of your business. With all this on one page, you can internalise the company and how it functions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When taking a possibly untested concept or idea, you can use the BMC to make sure that it makes business sense to pursue that idea or concept. There can be great concepts or ideas that actually don’t work out because you cannot make the business case for them. In design, especially service design, this is ok. The business viability is as important as the desirability, the technological feasibility and the sustainability. This goes back to the Venn diagram shown to you in Module 1.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/image2.png" title=""/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;How you use the Business Model Canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The BMC, because of how it is set up with different sides that focus on internal and external, is not necessarily filled in from left to right. It is not always sure that you will be able to fill in the whole thing in one sitting. It can be a work in progress especially if you are just starting out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this version of the BMC, there are 12 areas that . &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key Partners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Objective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cost Structure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key Activities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key Resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Value Proposition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Customer Relationships&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Channels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Revenue Streams &amp;amp; Potential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Customer Segments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Product End of Life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first 6 are all about the internal business while the next 6 are primarily about the customers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key Partners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is all about who you need to partner with to make your business happen: suppliers, collaborators, etc. Also, it is important to note what function they perform. Do they give you access to markets you wouldn’t have otherwise, do they reduce your risk/costs by supplying a key piece of infrastructure (digital or physical), etc. Who are they and what do they do? What reputation do they have? How sustainable are they? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Objective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is where you define the reason you are starting this business. Be specific and clear about your purpose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cost Structure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is about recognising the cost of doing business. What do you need to invest in to make your business actually work? What is most expensive for you? Fixed costs, variable costs, etc. Do sustainable alternatives exist? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key Activities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; are what you need to do so that you deliver on your Value Proposition. What customer relationships do you need to build, what distribution channels do you need to make sure you use, etc. How can these help you to achieve your sustainability goals? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key Resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; are related to the Key Activities, that is why they are next to each other. These are what is needed resource-wise to deliver the value proposition through the identified distribution channels, starting and maintaining customer relationships, etc. Are the resources we are using considered high risk? Are there alternatives? Consider all kinds of resources: Natural, energy (fossil vs renewable), technical, human, financial, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key Metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is about measuring how you are doing in regards to your goals. How does your company measure success? How are issues such as sustainability taken into account and measured? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Value Proposition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is always something special that your company has that you deliver to the customer. The answer to the real problem that customers are having. Defining the customers’ needs that you are satisfying for each customer segment. How do your customers expect you to deliver on sustainability promises or their own expectations? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Customer Relationships&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; reflect the type of relationships that you have with one or more customer segments. Which have you done already, how costly they are and are there options? In many services there are a basic three levels of involvement: do it yourself, done with your, or done for you. What does your company do? How and what will you build that supports sustainable customer relationships? How can your company help your customers make more sustainable choices? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Channels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; are the ways in which you reach your customers. It is important to know where your customers are and how they will find you. Know which channels work best for which customer type and how you can integrate those into your business. It is also important to know which channels you are using at different times during the customer journey: awareness, evaluation, purchase, delivery and after sales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Revenue Streams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; looks at how your company brings in income. What customers are willing to pay and how they would prefer to pay. Do they want a subscription model or a one-time fee? Are you offering to licence your product or service? Are you working B2B or B2C? What ways do you have to make money? Are there any subsidies or tax breaks available for being more sustainable? How could you leverage your level of sustainability to earn more? It is very possible that the company has multiple revenue streams. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Customer Segments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; are the customer groupings that you are going to be serving. How do you define these segments? Can you divide your customers into different segments by their motivation for buying your product (this type of segmentation is better than traditional demographic segmentation) as they will speak a similar language and will better identify themselves in your marketing. Is sustainability important to them, can you increase your customer base by being more sustainable? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Product End of Life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a section that is really important for those that are creating physical products. What happens to products that have reached their end of life is important to design at the beginning of the process to help individuals deal with this process. Has your product been designed with a view of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;upcycling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;/reusing/recycling? Is it easy to refurbish? Do you offer customers the possibility to return the product to you? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like mentioned above, you will not fill this in from left to right, feel free to jump around to the sections that you already know.
