At the bottom of the photo, you will see how they have used it to describe their own organisation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[MADLIBS VISUAL]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Building A Short Or Long Full Pitch &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most often called a Pitch Deck, there are specific things that need to be included in this deck. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Outside of the impactful story, you need to consider who your audience is: Is this internal or external? Are you looking for a co-founder or investment? All of these require you to highlight different things in your pitch. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consider any pitch to be 3 separate parts:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pitch deck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pitch script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pitch delivery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Pitch Deck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Pitch Canvas©&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One way of starting to think about your pitch deck and what you want to write in it, is to utilise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://best3minutes.com/the-pitch-canvas/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1731120085669566&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3DxvmmNIEi5P3AY2oU0M-k"&gt; The Pitch Canvas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;© which was created by the Dutch company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://best3minutes.com/the-pitch-canvas/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1731120085669789&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw20CUkFrGEg3owpWknS81v8"&gt; Best 3 Minutes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[PITCH CANVAS VISUAL]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Download your own from: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pitch canvas is a tool that you can use to get your ideas down on one paper and organise your thoughts as you reflect on the questions it has. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you have reflected on the things that you have to say, it is a good time to look at the actual slides that your pitch deck should have. Many people have many different names for the same or similar ideas. You will see this if you Google something like ‘pitch deck template’ or ‘what is needed for a pitch deck’. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pitch Deck Template &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One example comes from Guy Kawasaki, something he calls “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1731120085670310&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2Hyp5RK4Z66S44KAQiAF_f"&gt;The Only 10 Slides You Need in Your Pitch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;”. While these might not actually be the only 10 slides someone actually needs, it is a really great illustration that 1) you do not need a lot of slides (nobody wants to get whiplash from your pitch deck), 2) it covers most of the slides you will need, and 3) he provides a nice template for everyone to use while showing that each slide should not contain a huge amount of text.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pitch deck is not there for you to cram as much information on it as possible, it is about highlighting the most important information on the slide. Think of it like this, you don’t want someone being able to replicate your work just from one pitch deck. You want highlights that you can build a story around. Because you are the only one who knows the story, this deck is yours!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When walking onto a stage to pitch a new concept or business idea to anyone you want to convince to invest in your vision, you create a pitch deck that includes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;NAME OF YOUR IDEA &amp;amp; TAGLINE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;PROBLEM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;SOLUTION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;VALUE PROPOSITION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;BUSINESS MODEL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;LANDSCAPE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;TEAM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;CURRENT &amp;amp; FUTURE STATUS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;ASK / CALL TO ACTION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is important to note that there is a difference between your pitch deck and your pitch script. We will go through the pitch script in the next lesson. But here it is important to remember that while you are making the slides, they aren’t necessarily entirely reflective of what you say. A good example of this is when you are introducing yourself. You will say the words but you will not have a slide with your name on it. This is why there is no introduction slide on the deck list above. So keeping this in mind, we will go slide-by-slide in the next section and will indicate where you can add your own intro (but it will not have a slide itself). There are also two possible places to add in the introduction, so you can choose one. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[VISUAL]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Slide-by-slide In Detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With the limited amount of text that should be on each of the slides, you need to really hone your message. It is also important to make sure that you utilise visual elements (icons, photos, graphics, etc.). Here is a step-by-step thought process for each slide. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;TAGLINE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This should have a certain rhythm so it's easy to say and easy to remember. This needs to be snappy and memorable for the audience also. A great way to figure this out is to put words onto sticky notes (one important word per note), and then go about trying different ways of formulating it. For another way of crafting a tagline, check out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.columnfivemedia.com/the-secrets-behind-a-great-tagline/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1731120085671564&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0g3GV61iVQS2CdQOCt6PUu"&gt; this article from Column Five Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Examples of Taglines:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Washington Post — “Democracy Dies in Darkness.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Samsung — “Inspire the World, Create the Future”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;VISA — “It’s everywhere you want to be.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;3M — “Science. Applied to life.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(FIRST CHANCE TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;PROBLEM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The problem slide is probably the most important of all the slides. People want to know what you will be solving (and essentially, why they should care). This is all about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;who&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is having the problem and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;what&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the problem is. This should be kept to short statements (basically bullet points) and elaborated on in the pitch script. This is a good place to put numbers to show that you have done your research. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example: X% of X is wasted, or X# of X segment group have faced this problem, etc. You can see some pitch decks from famous brands now if you go online and search for “famous pitch deck examples”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slidebean.com/templates/uber-pitch-deck&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1731120085672257&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2y60_-UKYbNEasbXnEksNe"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slidebean.com/templates/uber-pitch-deck&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1731120085672388&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1TN3_xzCKcWpy9BZm9DbMz"&gt;Uber’s pitch deck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; had two slides for the problem. You can see how they were able to really be brief with their words but still illustrate the problem they were solving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;SOLUTION &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The solution slide comes right after the problem slide. First you describe the problem, then immediately follow up and let them know your solution. It is important that you make this ambitious but not unbelievable. Be realistic in your innovation. You can include a mock-up visual with a high-resolution photo and avoid using bullet points. It should be simple but impactful. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;VALUE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the problem slide addresses the who and the what, this value slide is all about the why. It is always vital to show what the value of your product or service is. WHY should the investors care and what is in it for the customer? For the most part, there are three ways to show value: How it will make life better, it will save money, or it will save time. Or, hopefully, a combination of these. Make sure you highlight what is the value of your solution in a relatable and easy-to-understand way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;BUSINESS MODEL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Businesses are around to make money through creating value with their customers. But earning money can be done in many ways. It could be from saving money from being spent on unnecessary things as well as from generating new revenue. It can also be about saving the time of the employees who are now free to work on different or more projects. So your business model is about what the costs are of creating this service/product but also how much revenue (if any) it will generate. It is also about how you generate it. Including key metrics (and financial projections if required) is also important so the audience can understand what you will measure to track your success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are so many business models out there. These were investigated by a team at the University of St Gallen, which turned into an innovation spin-off itself called BMI Labs. On their website, you are able to explore the identified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://businessmodelnavigator.com/explore&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1731120085673103&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1R4-VwuhM_Kb348kMtpRfC"&gt; business model patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;LANDSCAPE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The landscape slide is all about the environment that you will be operating in. It is the information that you have discovered when looking at understanding the market. This means the competition and the market behaviour should be investigated and understood. It also means that you need to talk about how you will fit into this market. How will you stand out from your competitors? Understanding that competitors don’t just come from the same product but from the same outcome. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A simple example of this would be a candle company. A candle doesn’t just compete with other candles. A candle can be defined as part of a relaxing process or wellness. It can also be defined as a reasonably-priced gift. So as a company, they are competing with others in the relaxing/wellness space or the reasonably-priced gift space. You need to really understand your customer and market space to be able to be a real competitor. Just as Uber doesn’t just compete with other taxi companies, they are also competing with car ownership. Showing that you understand your 360 marketplace is important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;TEAM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You finally get to talk about the team that is working on solving this problem. Team is also one of the things that investors are really looking at when it comes to early investments. They need to have faith that you are committed to the problem, that each team member brings something important to the team, and that you can complement each other’s skills. It is also important to recognise any skills that you currently lack. This will show that you understand where you need to invest in personnel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;CURRENT &amp;amp; FUTURE STATUS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When looking at the current &amp;amp; future status of your solution, explain where you are regarding testing, piloting, etc. and have a timeline and possibly a visual for the next version. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are seeking some kind of investment, it is also important to mention how you will use whatever it is you are asking for (this can be primarily in what you say). Whether this is money, access to certain industries, or mentorship. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(THIS IS  YOUR SECOND CHANCE TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF - if you didn't earlier)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;ASK/CALL TO ACTION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The kind of pitch you are making, will determine how and what you are asking for. This is something that you need to really think about. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Internally, you may be asking for human resources to implement a new project or to allocate your time to this as a separate project. You may even want to advocate for an in-house incubator for you and others to explore ideas in a more innovative way. There are many things to pitch for. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If it is for an investor or a co-founder, etc., you have to be specific in what you are looking for and reiterate what you are going to do with it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be precise, concise, and know your solution so you can answer most questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Template Resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Madlibs Template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pitch Canvas Template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>
