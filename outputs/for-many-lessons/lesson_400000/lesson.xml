        <title>Why We Pitch</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pitching is something that all company owners need to do. It is a combination of marketing and personal performance. Sometimes the pitches will be small (one customer with one product) and sometimes the financing of your entire company will depend on this skill. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pitching is done to many different audiences; sometimes you will be pitching to investors, to attract your first real employee, or a co-founder for your early startup. On the other side of pitching, you may need to pitch an idea to a colleague you really want to start a new internal project with or convince your own CEO that your idea is worth the investment of your time and other resources. Daniel Pink discusses this using anecdotes, studies, and insights in his book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.danpink.com/books/to-sell-is-human/%25C2%25A0&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1731120085661966&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2r9Cn1m0Ko6i0N4LhnWNp9"&gt; To Sell Is Human&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. He explores how we are all ‘working in sales’ in every part of our lives. He also has some templates for creating different kinds of pitches. All of these will help to hone this craft of pitching.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have all had a terrible experience of someone calling us or approaching us in a shopping mall wanting to try to sell us something. Most of the time, it is not something that we want or need. It feels uncomfortable because we just want them to leave us alone. These kinds of unsolicited selling interactions are a kind of pitch. These pitches are made to pretty “cold customers” - customers who have not necessarily shown an interest in what you are doing. They haven’t done any research into what kind of client you might be, so the pitch they have is not tailored to you in any way. This is why it doesn’t feel good. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[VISUAL]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But when you are selling ideas, either internally or externally, and you have done your homework, you are able to convey value properly. We pitch ideas and concepts in order to fill a need or to solve a, hopefully, real problem. If these have not been identified specifically, then it may be too early to pitch. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pitching Internally vs Externally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Internally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, we are always looking at what we do to help the company be more of something - more profitable, more sustainable, more efficient, more impact, etc. It is usually stated in the strategy. So it is important to make that link between what the company says it wants to achieve and how your proposal will help to make that happen. In order for people to do this, they have to convince others of their own and their idea’s ability to achieve the goal. This is much more of a collaborative approach to moving forward on an idea but make no mistake, this still requires you to be able to pitch. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;External&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; pitching is when you are pitching to someone who is not already attached to your company or your idea. This is much more of a transactional approach. You want something they have (money, influence, market access, expertise, etc) and you are trying to convince them to trade it for what you are offering. You need to make your offering interesting enough, valuable enough, for them to be willing to give up their resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is why we pitch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Successful pitching&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Successful pitching requires you to focus on 4 key ingredients:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Knowing your idea inside and out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your pitch deck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An impactful story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your pitch delivery &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Knowing your idea inside and out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using this service design sprint process, by the time you are at the point where you are pitching, you should know the real problem, understand from your customer research why it is a problem and have tested one or more ways of fixing it. In other words, you should know this issue inside out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to this, you should have looked into the surrounding market to see that there is a business case for it. If the organisation cannot sustain the cost of the solution, then it is not the right solution. In the service design process, solutions must serve both the needs of the customer and those of the business. There must be balance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stories that make a difference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your customer research should have highlighted a story that you can tell of a real person and the effect that both the problem and the solution have on their lives. This is the Impactful story that you will tell. Kiva.org, the micro loans company has been known for the power of the story. This is why, to this day, every loan request on their website comes with a story of who the investor will be loaning their money to. Stanford University uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/case-studies/kivaorg-power-story&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1731120085664881&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0bqdZn1H3pO8-Q1Iy3i7Rs"&gt; Kiva’s story as a case study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in their Graduate School of Business. There is also an&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://shows.acast.com/inside-influence/episodes/jessica-jackley-the-story-of-kiva-how-to-change-the-world-th&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1731120085665238&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1sD-qegGtUOe7EuzYhzU3V"&gt; interesting podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; with Jessica Jackley (Kiva.org co-founder) about the impact of a story. Jackley has also participated in TED Talks and other speaking engagements around the concept of storytelling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your pitch deck and your pitch delivery are what the next lesson is focused on. But first...Review!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the most important aspect of a pitch?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;that we say all the right words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;the fact that the company is addressing a real need&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;that the audience is full of investors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;the fact that the company has previously raised money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why is it important to have an impactful story to go along with your pitch?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stories are easier to remember&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People love stories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stories connect people to your mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because stories are easy to come up with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>
