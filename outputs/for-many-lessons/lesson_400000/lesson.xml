        <title>Finding the Right Problem</title>
        <contents>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why you probably don't know the real problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In traditional problem solving methods, it is normal to jump to an assumption of the problem(s). This happens when someone states that there is a problem and that there should be a “brainstorming session” to solve the problem. This action of jumping to brainstorm solutions with just an internal team is not very helpful when trying to solve real problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each employee will have a piece of a customer’s experience or story either through direct contact or second hand information. But this is not a reliable place to start. Every person has only a piece of a larger puzzle. The assumption may be correct for one piece but once put into a larger context, it no longer is the right problem to solve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hbr.org/2012/09/are-you-solving-the-right-problem&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1731120022537588&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3AjgKiXQBnRSIPRRXHElD-"&gt;Real problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; take time to understand. By jumping to solutions too early, you may end up solving something that is a symptom of the larger problem and not the problem itself. The organisation may also miss out on other opportunities or waste resources by solving the wrong problem. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;When helping doesn't help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the biggest ideation problems is that people really want to help. Why is that a problem? you ask.  Well, it is a problem because it tends to have people rush ahead trying to solve the problem with only these small pieces of the puzzle without knowing where the corners or the edge pieces are. What the situation really needs is an understandable framework where certain processes are followed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Without the customer research at the beginning of this process, you will not be able to determine which is the right problem to solve. This is why the first part of the service design process is sometimes referred to as the “Do the right thing” phase. Working your way through the “Do the right thing” phase with proper research and discovery will then lead you to the “Do the thing right” half. This stage is all about making sure that you solve the problem in the best, most impactful way possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doing the right thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[DOUBLE DIAMOND VISUAL]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 have shown how to do the research, how to decide and create one or more personas, it explained how each persona has their customer journey and how to identify the low points on the emotional journey. From this information, it is possible to determine which potential problems we can aim to solve. Depending on the level of the journey map, will tell us how specific or general a problem is. If the journey map is quite high level, meaning level 1 or 2, then it would be useful to drill down to a deeper level on that specific part of the customer journey. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In our example in Chapter 2 when we looked at the problem with calling the service, it is unknown what part of that process was problematic from the level of the journey map. It is possible that this information came out in the customer research, so it is important to look there again and map the service more in detail. It is important to know if the problem is with finding the phone number, being on hold for too long, being passed around from different people, etc. You just don’t necessarily know. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you have confirmed that you have a real problem to solve, it is important to make sure that you are solving it in the right way. That leads us to the second phase: “Do the thing right”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doing the thing right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[DOUBLE DIAMOND VISUAL]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once the research is done, the problems have been identified and narrowed down to one or two that you want to fix, now it is time to look at how you can start to tackle the problem. In order to start to tackle the problem(s) you have identified, you need to refine your problem into an answerable question. A question that is not too narrow and not too broad. This question will be the foundation of being able to “Do the thing right”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You need to refine your problem into an answerable question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;How might we create an actionable question?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The sub-title of this section is a clue as to how we create the actionable question that we want to answer. These questions always start with ‘How Might We’ and are referred to as ‘how might we’ questions or even HMW questions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reason for the words How Might We is simple. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;- this invites questioning, admits there is a problem, is solution-oriented, and open  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Might &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;- this word accepts and encourages many different ideas and encourages optimism that it can be accomplished&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;- tells us that it is a collaborative effort, that not just one person has the answer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The anatomy of the How Might We question is important because it is a team effort. No idea or solution comes out fully formed. It is when you bring together the knowledge of the research, the experience of the team and the person facilitating the process, you will have a very constructive ideation session. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[VISUAL]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Goldilocks problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In pursuing the How Might We question to lead your ideation, you need to avoid the Goldilocks problem - not too big, not too small, but just right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the problem question is too large, you will be unable to solve the problem with the time and resources you have available. When the problem is too narrow, it is usually suggesting a solution already in the problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stanford’s d.school has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/how-might-we-questions&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1731120022540663&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3Vt9sMs-QGOE2L3nSelTE1"&gt; a great example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; of this balance regarding ice cream. Here is a visual that recreates the spectrum and balance: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[HMW QUESTION VISUAL]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this example, you can see how the first HMW question is too narrow because it is already suggesting a solution in the form that narrows the solution to a cone of some type. Technically, if you wanted to go along this route, you could change the HMW question to HMW create an ice cream eating experience without any mess? The thing that you need to remember is that there is not ONE right question. There can be many questions that work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The last example, “HMW redesign dessert?”, is really far too broad. It is not even possible to answer this question. First, the term dessert is different to many different people and/or cultures. Second, redesign dessert from what? It is impossible to do this. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the middle is a question that has the right amount of curiosity, challenge, and possibility. This is a question that allows for many different answers and solutions. It is possible to explore many different options before deciding on one, two or three to prototype later on. It means that all options are on the table. This is also an example as to why you should, as the saying goes, “love the problem, not the solution”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As long as you are loving the problem (basically, the HMW question) you are open to any solution from anywhere. It won’t necessarily come from the loudest or highest-ranking person in the room. It probably won’t come from one person at all. Great solutions do not come out fully formed, they are a combination of ideas, feedback, iterations, and collaboration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Great solutions do not come out fully formed, they are a combination of ideas, feedback, iterations, and collaboration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>
