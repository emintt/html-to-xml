        <title>Pitch Script &amp;amp; Pitch Design</title>
        <contents>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now that the pitch deck is ready, I am sure that ideas have popped up about what will be said for each one. This is what we call the pitch script. Just like a script for a movie, it is a line-by-line description of what you will say during the entire pitch. Every word counts. The time pressure element of a pitch means that you have to script what you will say. Another way of saying this is that you are using speaker’s notes. Except the plan is to memorise them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Pitch Script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Start with a stream of consciousness of what you would want to say for each slide. Then edit this. Writing everything you say will help you to internalise what it is that you need to say. It will also help you to regulate how long the pitch takes. If you have 5 minutes and it is taking you 7 minutes, then you know that something has to be taken out. It is easier to edit on paper than in your head. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another thing to keep in mind is potential follow up comments or questions from those listening. These might come in the form of objections, why this idea or concept wouldn't work or in the form of further enquiries into numbers (market size, financials) or customers, etc. You can decide to add these slides to your deck at the end if you want (this shows that you have thought about these issues already and have something prepared) or you can just have answers prepared in your mind. Both work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When creating your main slides, you can create a list of must use words that you form into sentences to make sure that you are having maximum impact with your X number of minutes. Once you think that you have the right balance of impactful words and that you also balance reality with aspiration, it is time to start planning the pitch delivery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[VISUAL]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Pitch Delivery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three words that will determine how you do pitching in the spotlight: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Practice, Practice, Practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Much like a part in a movie or play, pitching on stage is about a convincing performance. It is about practising until you know it forwards and backwards. When you do this, you give yourself the best possible chance at the best possible outcome. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You should be practicing it with a stopwatch and with a camera. But most importantly, with the stopwatch. Whatever situation you have created where you have a chance to pitch, will have a time limit. It might be 3 minutes, it might be 5 minutes, or it might be 10. And you should tailor your pitch to the parameters given to you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Focus on speed and clarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first run through can just be you sitting down reading the script and seeing how long that takes. If it is way too long, then do some edits and then try again. Remember to keep your voice calm and talk at a normal speed. There is a tendency to rush when we speak in front of a crowd. But this is why we practice. To get those “first-time jitters” out of the way.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you are fairly confident that your script represents the amount of time you have, it is good to practice with your slides and in a standing position. You will still need your stopwatch. See what happens when you now have to ‘multi-task’. From the time it takes, you will see where you need to adjust what you are doing or saying. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get out there and Pitch!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>
