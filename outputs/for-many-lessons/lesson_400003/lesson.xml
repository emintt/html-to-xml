        <title>Making the Business Case</title>
        <contents>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the Business Model Canvas?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The original Business Model Canvas (BMC) is a strategic tool that was developed back in 2005 by Alexander Osterwalder (and released in 2008) to quickly and simply define and communicate the business model of an idea or concept. That being said, it is also used by teams to contemplate and define the way that their business idea or concept will make money, bring value to customers, and be a foundation for further development. One of the main features of the BMC is that it is one page. This feature is what helps to make it easy to understand and share with others. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another feature of the BMC is that while it is split into different sections, it can also be split down the middle where the left side focuses on the internal business and the right side focuses on the segments related to external customers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The world has changed since 2008 and there are now some additional important issues that need to be considered when developing businesses. Primarily one of sustainability. The original BMC is a great template to adjust to fit changing needs. One of its original main purposes was to be simple enough to react to and reflect changes in the business environment and operations. So it is not a real stretch to incorporate something as important as sustainability.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to reflect the modern requirements of business, that of Feasibility, Desirability, Viability, and Sustainability, this modified version of the BMC was created by  Metropolia University of Applied Science. Referred to as the Metropolia Business Model Canvas (MBMC), the original prompts are mostly there but they have been supplemented by additional questions that help you ask the right kinds of questions to embed sustainability into your concept.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[VISUAL MBMC]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why do you use the Business Model Canvas?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Making money is an essential part of any company. It is also an essential part of most organisations, even if it isn’t the main purpose for your organisation. The MBMC is a great way to quickly understand for internal teams or external stakeholders how your business makes money and what makes it different from other companies. Another important feature is that it is a simple enough tool that it can be iterated and changed at any time. The MBMC (or any other BMC) is never meant to be a static document - it is a constant 'work in progress'. This document is also not meant to be used as an official document and will not enable you to get a business loan nor will it be required to set up a company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The MBMC is a simple one-page document used as an internal tool so that everyone understands what your company does, how you make money, who your company serves, how you reach them, what your special features are, and the simple financial incomings and outgoings of your business. With all this on one page, your team can more easily internalise the company and how it functions. Additionally, and very importantly, sustainability is best built into a business from the very beginning design phase. It is much harder to add sustainability into an existing business or concept at a later date after many decisions have been made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When taking a possibly untested concept or idea, you can use the MBMC to make sure that it makes business sense to pursue that idea or concept. There can be great concepts or ideas that actually don’t work out because you cannot make the business case for them. In design, especially service design, this is ok. The business viability is as important as the desirability, the technological feasibility and the sustainability. This goes back to the Venn diagram shown to you in Chapter 1.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[SUSTAINABILITY VENN DIAGRAM]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;How you use the Metropolia Business Model Canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The MBMC, because of how it is set up with different sides that focus on internal and external, is not necessarily filled in from left to right. It is almost guaranteed that you will NOT be able to fill in the whole thing in one sitting. It is a work in progress especially when you are just starting out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the MBMC, there are 12 areas that help you construct your business idea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key Partners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key Activities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Value Proposition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Revenue Streams &amp;amp; Potential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Objective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key Resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Customer Relationships&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Customer Segments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cost Structure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Channels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan="1" rowspan="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Product End of Life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;﻿First 6 for Internal Business, Last 6 for Customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key Partners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is all about who you need to partner with to make your business happen: suppliers, collaborators, etc. Also, it is important to note what function they perform. Do they give you access to markets you wouldn’t have otherwise, do they reduce your risk/costs by supplying a key piece of infrastructure (digital or physical), etc. Who are they and what do they do? What reputation do they have? How sustainable are they? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Objective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is where you define the reason you are starting this business. Be specific and clear about your purpose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cost Structure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is about recognising the cost of doing business. What do you need to invest in to make your business actually work? What is most expensive for you? Fixed costs, variable costs, etc. Do sustainable alternatives exist? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key Activities &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;are what you need to do so that you deliver on your Value Proposition. What customer relationships do you need to build, what distribution channels do you need to make sure you use, etc. How can these help you to achieve your sustainability goals? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key Resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; are related to the Key Activities, that is why they are next to each other. These are what is needed resource-wise to deliver the value proposition through the identified distribution channels, starting and maintaining customer relationships, etc. Are the resources we are using considered high risk? Are there alternatives? Consider all kinds of resources: Natural, energy (fossil vs renewable), technical, human, financial, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Key Metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is about measuring how you are doing in regards to your goals. How does your company measure success? How are issues such as sustainability taken into account and measured? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Value Proposition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is always something special that your company has that you deliver to the customer. The answer to the real problem that customers are having. Defining the customers’ needs that you are satisfying for each customer segment. How do your customers expect you to deliver on sustainability promises or their own expectations? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Customer Relationships&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; reflect the type of relationships that you have with one or more customer segments. Which have you done already, how costly they are and are there options? In many services there are a basic three levels of involvement: do it yourself, done with your, or done for you. What does your company do? How and what will you build that supports sustainable customer relationships? How can your company help your customers make more sustainable choices? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Channels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; are the ways in which you reach your customers. It is important to know where your customers are and how they will find you. Know which channels work best for which customer type and how you can integrate those into your business. It is also important to know which channels you are using at different times during the customer journey: awareness, evaluation, purchase, delivery and after sales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Revenue Streams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; looks at how your company brings in income. What customers are willing to pay and how they would prefer to pay. Do they want a subscription model or a one-time fee? Are you offering to licence your product or service? Are you working B2B or B2C? What ways do you have to make money? Are there any subsidies or tax breaks available for being more sustainable? How could you leverage your level of sustainability to earn more? It is very possible that the company has multiple revenue streams. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Customer Segments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; are the customer groupings that you are going to be serving. How do you define these segments? Can you divide your customers into different segments by their motivation for buying your product (this type of segmentation is better than traditional demographic segmentation) as they will speak a similar language and will better identify themselves in your marketing. Is sustainability important to them, can you increase your customer base by being more sustainable? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Product End of Life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a section that is really important for those that are creating physical products. What happens to products that have reached their end of life is important to design at the beginning of the process to help individuals deal with this process. Has your product been designed with a view of upcycling/reusing/recycling? Is it easy to refurbish? Do you offer customers the possibility to return the product to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As mentioned above, you will not fill this in from left to right, feel free to jump around to the sections that you already know. There are so many articles and videos already made to explain the original BMC, that all you have to do is Google it if you need more information. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Further Resources and Templates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Strategyzer (2.20)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Business Channel (9:41)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sheda Medium page (7 min read)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prioritisation Matrix Template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;MBMC Template with Prompts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>
