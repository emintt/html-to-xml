Entrepreneurial Mindset</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In 2017, Finland&rsquo;s Ministry of Education and Culture determined that entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial mindset should become a part of the education system. The entrepreneurial mindset is something that can be learned and it is also considered a &ldquo;life wide&rdquo; skill. Meaning that it is something that benefits other parts of an individual&rsquo;s life outside of work. The definition that the Ministry provided was: </span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Entrepreneurship means observing possibilities and grasping them, as well as the ability to transform ideas into actions that produce financial, cultural, social or societal value. ... They include creativity, the ability to innovate, risk management, and responsibility, as well as the ability to plan, specify goals, and direct operations to reach objectives. The changes taking place in the working life emphasize the significance of entrepreneurial skills.&rdquo; - Finland&#39;s ministry of Education &amp; Culture (2017)</span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://okm.fi/en/entrepreneurship-training-and-education&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727769458348821&amp;usg=AOvVaw2QT-T8ATwYPTaTUmavEdlQ">More about entrepreneurship and education</a></span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.m7offsoodsw0"><span class="c20 c8">9 fundamentals of the entrepreneurial mindset </span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is important to note that these skills and competencies are not individual, they are all interdependent on each other. You may have some of these already and others you need to practise but the ability to innovate, for example, requires you to be problem-centred as well as proactive, creative, a good networker, etc. Being creative will require you to tolerate risk and failure. They are all interconnected and it is the sum of these skills and competencies that will propel you forward in whatever you do. Embracing these skills and competencies is not only good for entrepreneurs, it is good for everyone. This is why it is not called the entrepreneur&rsquo;s mindset but the entrepreneurial mindset. It is a way of being and of tackling challenges throughout life.</span></p><ul class="c3 lst-kix_321cdb99ywyx-0 start"><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Ability to innovate</span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Creativity</span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Pro-activeness</span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Teamwork</span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Tolerance to risk-taking</span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Tolerance of failure </span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Plan &amp; reach objectives</span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Problem-centred</span></li><li class="c0 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Networking</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is said that the path to success is littered with &quot;failures&quot;...but from each one something new is learned. The only real failure is when you don&#39;t learn something. Everything else is learning. There is no moral judgement in failure in itself. </span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.visv6va19qe6"><span class="c20 c8">Why we need the Entrepreneurial Mindset</span></h3><p class="c30"><span>&quot;Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people. It will keep you cramped and insane your whole life, and it is the main obstacle between you and a shitty first draft.&quot; </span><span class="c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%2520First%2520Drafts.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727769458351210&amp;usg=AOvVaw38KmyuGdPrLdAV6ZhLCyab">Anne Lamott </a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Staring at a blank page is hard. Trying to come up with ideas is hard. Knowing where to start can be hard. Writing a &ldquo;shitty first draft&rdquo; is there to take the procrastination/paralysed feeling out of the equation. Many times we have been convinced that things need to be pretty perfect before we write them down or that we will be judged by that first idea (so we better make it good). But this is why risk-taking and accepting failure are so important to the entrepreneurial mindset. Failure is just learning with another name (a name that helps others feel better about themselves&hellip;it doesn&#39;t actually help anyone). Everyone who has ever succeeded has failed. It is only through failure that success comes. There is no other way. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The expectation of perfection kills creativity and makes new ideas impossible. Nothing that you use throughout your day is the first draft. Not the dishes that you eat from, not the news stories you consume, not the search engine you use to find things, and not one single app you use on your phone. Nothing comes out fully formed and perfect. Everything has required multiple drafts (some people call this failure, those who know, call this learning and improvement). Start somewhere!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Almost all jobs now require an entrepreneurial mindset, whether you are working within a company or whether you go down the actual entrepreneur route, these skills and attitudes will serve you well. None of the fundamental skills listed above are specific to being an entrepreneur. These are all transferable skills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can use these skills of determination, creativity, risk, failure, teamwork, innovation, curiosity, self-belief, and pro-activeness to start a business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">OR</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can use these skills of determination, creativity, risk, failure, teamwork, innovation, curiosity, self-belief, and pro-activeness as an employee.</span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.2muhqdayjch9"><span class="c20 c8">You can practise the entrepreneurial mindset</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You may feel that you need to practise some of these skills. Luckily for you, these are skills and competencies that you can practise. There are ways that you can practise the different skills and competencies that are included in the entrepreneurial mindset. Most of them will require you to get outside of your comfort zone, because let&rsquo;s be honest, if it wasn&rsquo;t uncomfortable, you might already have the skills. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Listed below are the skills and competencies that you can practise and each has links attached to learn more about how you can do that.</span></p><h4 class="c45" id="h.btpgyv7co2jc"><span class="c5">Creativity</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Creativity is an interesting skill because so many people connect it to fine arts and things like that. But creativity is something that is really anything that uses the imagination or original ideas to create something new and valuable or considered inventive. These can be tangible or intangible things. There is </span><span class="c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/am-i-creative&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727769458353217&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YJtjRqxzPo-PKblBx1uAp">nothing inherent to art</a></span><span>&nbsp;at all. We are all creative in our own ways. &nbsp;</span><span class="c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DGy_2vcTza8c&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727769458353519&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pxxMUh5mGNwAdSvmoT6Cp">Practise creativity</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;here.</span></p><h4 class="c45" id="h.iomnd5kj7n4u"><span class="c5">Tolerate failure </span></h4><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Failure is a loaded word with a lot of feelings and emotions around it. But it is not inherently bad. It just means that something you tried did not work. We cannot expect to get everything right the first time. Failures also lead to some of the greatest discoveries. For example, 3M and the post-it note. If that glue had been as sticky as they had wanted, we would have no sticky notes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>Google the concept &ldquo;Failure CV&rdquo; - this is an interesting way of looking at &ldquo;success&rdquo; and what it takes to get there.

Increasing your risk tolerance is about getting out of your comfort zone and doing things that you normally wouldn&#39;t do. This is not the same as doing risky things that endanger you. This is about pushing the limits of your comfort zone so that you are confident to speak up in a meeting, willing to contact a person you normally wouldn&#39;t, trying something new to expand your enjoyment. All of these things can feel &#39;risky&#39; when in the big picture, they are not. It is more about building confidence. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/305985&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727769458355480&amp;usg=AOvVaw3lL7Kqy3EbSPQk6RRHVotM">Achieving greater success</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;article</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170606-you-can-teach-yourself-to-be-a-risk-taker&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727769458355963&amp;usg=AOvVaw0BvX0iDaG9oirCTP011avU">Teach yourself to be a risk taker</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;article</span></p><h4 class="c4" id="h.creq2hob0mmd"><span class="c5">Plan &amp; reach objectives</span></h4><p class="c0"><span>Start tracking goals in your life.

Surrounding any kind of service or product is a wide variety of stakeholders (people who have an interest or a concern in what you are producing). There are many kinds of stakeholders also. They might be financial stakeholders (they have funded the work or your company in some way), suppliers, employees, customers, users, or others outside the organisation that have some influence over your customer/user experience. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Creating real value is not really possible without some kind of co-creation. Deliberate and purposeful co-creation is the best starting point for creating real value for real stakeholders. You will notice that above customers and users were separated in the list of stakeholders. For some people these two words can be used interchangeably while for others, they are two distinct groups. It is always important to discuss the meaning of key words when starting any kind of co-creation process. For some, customers can be the users that pay while users are all the people that use the service or product (maybe a company has a freemium/premium service). Whereas for others, they consider all users to be customers or all customers to be users. You will also find that in some fields, they only talk about users (think public services). In this course, we will use the word &ldquo;customers&rdquo; to describe every person who uses a service or product regardless of whether they pay for it or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many people believe that we create products and services for customers because we know our customers so well. But this is generally not true. It is more akin to myth than reality. As professionals, we like to think that we provide a superior experience for our customers but the reality is different. Bain &amp; Company found a dramatic &ldquo;delivery gap&rdquo; after surveying 362 companies: </span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c26 c32">&quot;80% [of companies] believed they delivered a &ldquo;superior experience&rdquo; to their customers&rdquo; but their customers said &ldquo;that only 8% of companies were really delivering.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This statistic has driven a whole new industry segment to help people bridge the &ldquo;Delivery Gap&rdquo;. This gap is created in large part in how a company perceives their relationship with the customer. If a company believes that they create services and products for their customers [customer-focused approach], they believe that they already know what their customers want and make those. But as we can see, this approach does not begin to approach what the customer really wants. It is a perception that is filtered through many layers of someone else&rsquo;s (oftentimes many people&rsquo;s) assumptions. What addressing the delivery gap really requires is a shift of mindset from creating for to creating with customers to really discover what value means to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It requires a company to move from a more traditional &ldquo;customer-focused&rdquo; approach to a more modern &ldquo;customer-centric&rdquo; approach. Doing this will help a company be more efficient, more innovative, and more sustainable.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.19wu3qfzz6h1"><span class="c18 c8">[Section 2] Customer-focused Vs Customer-centric</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The concepts of customer-focused processes and customer-centric processes are different although many people think these are the same thing and use the terms interchangeably.

Being customer-focused can feel good to the customer because they are having their problem solved but is quite a reactive way to do business and does not solve the bigger picture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Being customer centric means that you keep the customer at the centre of all your decisions. It also means being proactive in terms of using the data you collect to pre-emptively address issues and problems that come up for the customers. It also means that you are continually trying to understand the context in which your customers are living and using your service so you can have them develop new features and products. </span></p><h3 class="c50" id="h.7u42skb8oime"><span class="c20 c8">EXAMPLE</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two electricity companies launched their new invoice format 2 months ago. Compare the two different processes:</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c9 c8">Customer-focused company</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">4 months prior to now: The sales team decided that the old invoice was starting to look a little old so they contacted their graphic designer to improve it. They wanted the same information presented just in a more visually pleasing and modern way. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same time, the customer service front line staff were continually answering phone calls to respond to customer&rsquo;s confusion over the information on their bills. The front-line staff were constantly having to explain, one customer at a time, what certain industry words meant and how the calculations were made, etc. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Neither of these two teams formally talked to each other and almost nobody on the two teams knew each other, even informally, as they were based in different offices. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After two months, and several rounds of comments from the sales team, the graphic designer was pretty much done with the re-design. After another month the new template was being used and the sales team was happy with their new, modern look. Meanwhile, just as many phone calls were coming into the customer service department because the information was still using language that the customer didn&rsquo;t understand but the customers did give compliments on the nice layout and were still thankful that the customer service agents were so friendly and helpful.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c8 c33">Customer-centric company</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">6 months ago a customer service manager in the company flagged the number of phone calls that they were receiving to ask for certain information on the company&rsquo;s invoice to be clarified. She brought this up at a weekly meeting where people from other departments came and asked how they could look into fixing the way the information is presented and/or explained. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One person from Sales and one person from marketing and she decided to meet independently to look into this issue. They asked that the data from the calls be brought so they could look through and here from the customers themselves what the problems were. She brought in some transcripts, some audio recordings of conversations, as well as one agent who had dealt with a lot of these calls. They listen and read and pull out the words that seem to be repeated. They &ldquo;interview&rdquo; the agent on what she is hearing from people and what are the areas that they struggle with. From here they notice that there is a pattern of not understanding the industry standard language being used (which is perfectly clear to them). So over the next few weeks they mock up 3 or 4 examples of possible invoice changes. Making sure that there is all the information that needs to be there. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They bring in the agent to review them and she makes a few suggestions for changes. These changes are incorporated and now they start to contact two sets of customers, 1) customers who have recently called for clarification and 2) a random selection of customers in general to see if they would be willing to look over the new designs. When they have about 5 for each group, they spend a total of 10 hours reviewing these and taking notes on what their observations are and how well they understood them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>After the feedback was processed, a brief was created for the graphic designer and a new invoice was created. Once it is launched, the customer service department notes that call volumes related to clarification have decreased a significant amount. This gives the staff more ability to get on with other tasks and also to proactively look for issues to solve.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c29 c22"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c23 title" id="h.prf0dymh1cuu"><span class="c19">Lesson 3: Introduction to Service Design</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.lkza8pyz2s5t"><span>[Section 1] </span><span class="c18 c8">The Design Thinking Process</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To talk about service design, you first need to talk about the design thinking process. The design thinking process is the path that you will walk (not always a straight one for sure) to get from your current state to your desired state. It is a path that requires a non-linear, co-creation-based iterative process. In this process its main aim is to understand users, define their real problem(s), eliminate assumptions, and create useful and creative solutions that have been prototyped and tested before full implementation. Service design is the application of the design thinking process to the development of services - whether paid for directly by the customer, via the public service, or the third sector (non-governmental organisations, etc.).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But design thinking is not only a process. It is also a mindset. Design thinking requires the participants to be able to suspend expectations and to not have any expected outcomes.It is accepting that we, in this beginning moment, do not know the answer and be open to the discovery. The design thinking process is where the discovery happens. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are many visualisations of the design thinking process. Each with slightly different names for essentially the same things. They differ in how they divide similar tasks. Some choose to break down tasks into smaller steps while others just represent an overall view of the process. As a representation of two of the most recognised processes, here is &nbsp;Stanford&rsquo;s d.School process and the Design Council&rsquo;s Double Diamond.</span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c35">Stanford d.school Design Thinking Process</span></p><p class="c46"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 397.65px; height: 225.86px;"><img alt="Stanford d.school" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 397.65px; height: 225.86px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Stanford&rsquo;s design thinking process consists of 5 parts: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">EMPATHISE = research the customer through various methods; learn who they are and what they do</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">DEFINE= distil what you learned about your customer and define the challenges/pain points they are having</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">IDEATE = co-create possibilities together and have as many ideas as you can, then sift through them and find the good ones</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">PROTOTYPE = take 1, 2, or 3 of those good ideas and build simple prototypes of them and see how they work in reality - iterate what doesn&rsquo;t work, fail fast, move forward</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">TEST= test the iterated, simple prototypes with real people and in real situations; change what doesn&rsquo;t work and create something useful </span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c35">Design Council&rsquo;s Double Diamond</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another way to visualise this process is the Design Council&rsquo;s Double Diamond. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The purpose of the double diamond is to represent visually what the process is in practice. The diamond shape in itself represents the divergent &lt; and convergent &gt; nature of the process. With the &lt; always being creating ideas and concepts and expanding on discussion points and the &gt; always being about eliminating the less ideal options (whether those are ideas in the first diamond or fuller concepts as in the second diamond). </span></p><p class="c25"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 500.00px; height: 293.33px;"><img alt="Design Council Double Diamond" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 500.00px; height: 293.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c22 c25"><span class="c38"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Double Diamond design process has four stages: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">DISCOVER is all about gathering data and learning about your customer. The objective of this stage is to hear and understand what is happening in your customer&rsquo;s life. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">DEFINE is where you begin to organise and group the data that you have gathered to reveal insights on the real problems they are facing. Defining the problem is the end of the first diamond and the beginning of the second. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">DEVELOP is where you begin to finally start to think about the solutions. Ideas, ideas, ideas and these ideas become concepts and, eventually, prototypes. You now know the problem, now look for a testable solution to build. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">DELIVER is the final step in the process where you are testing the 1, 2, or 3 prototypes that you decided on in the DEVELOP stage and see which one performs the best that you would be happy to either iterate more or use (sometimes, it is none and you need to go back a stage or 2&hellip;this happens and it is ok and part of the process!)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you can see overall, the steps that you do are the same, they just roughly divide them differently. Onwards through this course, we will use the Stanford d.School model as this process is more easily understood by looking at it. But first let&rsquo;s look at why we should use service design.</span></p><p class="c29 c22"><span class="c10"></span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.rv9ggwsqc89x"><span class="c8 c18">[Section 2] Why Service Design?</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like it said earlier, service design is the application of the design thinking process to the development of services. So it is this process we described above specifically with services in mind. This means that the methods of discovery and prototyping take different forms than say when you design a product. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Service design in itself is a tool to get a desirable outcome. Both your customer and the organisation determine what is &lsquo;desirable&rsquo;. This tool will help organisations to get to desirable services with more collaboration with the users which leads to less waste (of time, human resources, and materials). This allows the organisation to work in a more sustainable way - economic sustainability and environmental sustainability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>It is said that service design is the reason you </span><span class="c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DHNOY8GLVy_8&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727769458363695&amp;usg=AOvVaw3JhGc-Rvb3bzOHRsOdmMqy">choose one coffee shop</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;over another when the other variables are the same (pricing, quality, etc).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because services now account for about 80% of our economy, service design is more important now than ever before. But what is a service?</span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.4yo2gyblxq91"><span class="c20 c8">What is a Service?</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many people think of customer service when they think about service design. But if you look at the big picture, the majority of the need for customer service is because of poorly designed services. This isn&rsquo;t to say that if you do great service design, then a company won&rsquo;t need a customer service department (a company will always need this). Things will always go wrong, it is just about the scale at which they will go wrong. Too little consideration and proper research and you will be inundated with customers requiring clarification, fixing misunderstandings, explaining the process, etc. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A service is anything that &ldquo;helps someone do something&rdquo;. Whether that service is something that helps someone pay a bill (the payment options, service, even the paper/digital invoice) or login to something or even find something (online or in person services to check land registry, city websites to find where your child can go to school, or taking public transport).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the important elements of service design is that the value has to be balanced. A company or organisation, for real value, has to balance the benefits for both the producer of the service and the user of the service. It does not serve the organisation to consistently lose money in service because customers like it. They will not last long if this is the case. Them going out of business serves no one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Birgit Mager, Professor of service design and Head of the global Service Design Network, states services need to be &ldquo;useful, usable and desirable from the user perspective, and efficient, effective and different from the provider perspective&rdquo;. It is from this balance that the service can be successful.</span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.mjl14t3e3ryu"><span class="c20 c8">How to create balance</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To make sure that your services will be successful, it has been important to answer 3 questions outside of the actual process. These three questions are still relevant, but more recently, it has expanded to 4 questions to include the important lens of sustainability. Let&rsquo;s start by looking at the first three questions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Until recently, the end goal of any design process is the sweet spot of 3 characteristics: Desirability, Feasibility, and Viability. This goal is illustrated as a Venn diagram: </span></p><p class="c0 c22"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c30"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 313.58px; height: 246.84px;"><img alt="Sweet spot of innovation" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 402.03px; height: 246.84px; margin-left: -66.74px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">DESIRABILITY</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(this is where you start) = What do people want? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">FEASIBILITY </span><span class="c1">= Can we do it? Within our organisation and with our technology, is it possible?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">VIABILITY</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;= Is it financially possible to do this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That sweet spot (the place where these three elements overlap) is sometimes described as &lsquo;innovation&rsquo;, &lsquo;good service&rsquo;, &lsquo;useful innovation&rsquo;, &lsquo;the goal&rsquo;, &lsquo;the solution&rsquo;, etc. Whatever it is called, it is there that balance is created and it is a win-win situation. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we move further into the 2020s, it is important to emphasise one more important aspect of innovation: sustainability. This means that the Venn Diagram looks like this now:</span></p><p class="c30"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 591.00px; height: 211.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 591.00px; height: 211.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This means that if the innovation sweet spot is to be balanced and robust, like a table, it needs all 4 legs to be stable. This is the way to move forward in a way that is not only responsible to your business and your customers, but to the society and planet in which they are functioning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>For a deeper dive into adding sustainability in the innovation process, see </span><span class="c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/@daniel.cj228/innovation-sweet-spot-2-0-time-to-add-a-new-factor-sustainability-c83f6b59955c&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727769458365776&amp;usg=AOvVaw3RBKkINuDEDy4Har3IGX2v">this article</a></span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the beginning of the design process, when the research is being done and the initial ideas are being co-created, there is no need to put limits on what is being done. In fact, it is important that there are not these restrictions. But as you move through the process, and you get close to the prototyping and testing stages, reflecting on these three qualities becomes really important. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Service design forces you to trust the process. To believe that what is fuzzy and unknown at the beginning will become clearer and more manageable at the end. It also is a great teacher that we don&rsquo;t know everything about our customers. It is also a great teacher in failing fast, iterating and moving forward. Every failure is a learning. &nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.cgiu801t5qw3"><span class="c20 c8">How to do service design?</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c8">Empathise</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We empathise with the customers by finding out about their lives, the context that they live in. We do this by various methods of primary and secondary research. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Secondary research usually comes first (as strange as that sounds). also called desk research, it is where you take research that has already been done by others and review it. This research can be internal research done by other units such as customer surveys, market trends, competitor research, etc. Or it can be external research such as journal articles, news articles, general information, government statistics, etc. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Primary research is where you conduct the research yourself. One-on-one customer interviews, focus groups, silent observations, etc. The most important superpower you can have while conducting primary research is listening and watching. For this kind of research it is important to somehow record as much as you can. Whether that is with thorough notes or, more ideally, with some form of recording device (with the permission of the interviewee of course).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c8">Define </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We define the customer pain that we are trying to solve by taking this data and gaining insights. We look for patterns, highlights, what the real pain that the person is trying to solve. If the problem is not properly defined, then the pain they are experiencing will never go away. If you do not know the real pain, then you will miss the mark on creating a good service. This leads to two outcomes: 1) a customer will use another service, or 2) they will use even more resources from your company still trying to solve the problem. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once you think that you have a great understanding of the problem, then it is time to start thinking of ideas. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/from-design-thinking-to-creative-confidence&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727769458366989&amp;usg=AOvVaw26Qe7HzouopjRkJPSdEtcJ">Read an example of how service design transformed a service for young patients who needed an MRI.</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c8">Ideate</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Coming together to co-create as many possible ideas together is a great way to look at the problem in as many ways as possible. Making sure that everyone has the opportunity to participate and that the right people are in the room (a variety of different people involved directly in the service is vital) will ensure that you are starting from the right place. Creating a status-free and open environment will ensure a productive result. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once there are 10s of ideas on the table (or wall), then the evaluation and prioritisation must happen to take all those ideas and reduce them in an understandable and methodical way. Using a Prioritisation Matrix is useful at this stage. </span></p><p class="c30"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 500.00px; height: 354.67px;"><img alt="Prioritisation matrix" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 500.00px; height: 354.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By using this prioritisation matrix you can evaluate the ideas based on how much effort and impact they will make. This will reduce the number of ideas greatly and allow you to pick one, two or three that you want to look more deeply at through prototyping.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c9">Prototype</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that you have a few ideas that you want to test, you can begin building prototypes of them. These, in the service design context, can (and should) be very simple. There shouldn&rsquo;t be any coding involved in the first versions, these are really just mock ups in various materials and forms. Depending on if the service is physical or digital, will depend on how it is made. It can be a Lego representation, it can be a cardboard cutout, it can be using a tool such as Figma or Marvelapp for a simulated digital product. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The main idea with the prototype is to get it out in the real world, quickly iterate what doesn&rsquo;t work, fail fast, move forward and develop along the way. Building anything real means that it is no longer a prototype and you are investing too much time and money into something that may not be worth it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c8">Test</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The final part of the service design process is to test. Test and iterate your simple prototypes with real people and in real situations. By doing this and changing what doesn&rsquo;t work along the way, you will create something useful that customers want to (and can) use. </span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.b0llbw3cv5eq"><span class="c18 c8">Moving forward with sustainability</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By using this process, organisations are able to cut the time needed to go from problem to idea to solution. This helps to save them money, time, frustration, and materials. When using the service design process, then important issues can be addressed. One of the most important issues going forward is sustainability - more specifically, environmental sustainability, but also economic sustainability of businesses and societies. Sustainability is also an increasingly important driver for users and this needs to be understood and addressed within businesses to also be economically sustainable. &nbsp; </span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c22"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23 title" id="h.ft412rrfc8gj"><span class="c19">Lesson 4: Introduction to Design Sprints</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A Design Sprint is a specific process that moves business ideas from zero to tested in about 5 days. It is a process that was designed to reduce the amount of time it took to tackle business problems from an unspecified amount of time (sometimes running over a year) to an initial 5 day investment to get from problem to prototype to initial tests. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A Design Sprint takes a small team to dedicate 5 whole days to rapidly progress and fast-forward the design work. The final step of a design sprint is to get your prototype in front of potential or actual customers and get immediately actionable feedback. This process can be used in various areas of business, whether that is new product/service development and improvement, marketing campaigns, website development, etc. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the benefits of this process is to get the company out of their comfort zone in their usual development processes. </span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.vd7e8tg5rk02"><span class="c20 c8">Design Sprint Schedule</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>The original design sprint concept was created by a former Google employee called Jake Knapp. He has since written a book about this process called </span><span class="c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thesprintbook.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727769458369006&amp;usg=AOvVaw0M0nNKGUBDqpnacNNpIrfe">Sprint: How To Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days</a></span><span class="c1">.

In addressing the Sprint questions in relation to your goal, you will probably need to bring in some experts or those people who know more than you (or even customers) to interview. Their information will help the team decide the direction of the sprint and what will be tackled from day two onwards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c21">Day 2: Requires the team to ideate and sketch out possible solutions</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Working alone together&rdquo; is how a lot of the Sprint works during the sketching and the voting. This means that work is done individually and then discussed afterwards in the group. This allows people to develop ideas without influence from others and then ideas can be shared and possibly combined later. The ideas will develop and become more clear as the ideas are iterated and the day progresses. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c21">Day 3: Needs decisions to be made so that chosen ideas can become testable prototypes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a day with a lot of decisions being made. The full concepts from the day before will be presented and critiqued while also being weighed against the long-term goal. The one or two that have the best chance of achieving the long-term goal, will be storyboarded in the afternoon ready to be prototyped on Day 4!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c21">Day 4: Creates the testable prototypes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because the prototype needs to be created in one day, it will be more of a facade (like a fake front) for testing purposes only. If it is a digital prototype, then it can be made in a software that has a nice user interface, but has no real backend behind it. There are multiple softwares that can be used for this. If it is a physical prototype (like the flow of a store) or written prototype (like marketing messages), then these can be made in cardboard or on false materials to be tested. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c21">Day 5: This is testing day with real, live users.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watching and hearing the reactions of real people and customers to your efforts is what this week has been all about. It is about learning as much as you can as they interact with your prototypes and planning on how you can iterate them to make them as useful as possible. This day will ideally consist of 5 customer tests. After each interview, notes are compiled and compared on a whiteboard all while looking for patterns. This final day is wrapped up by creating a follow up plan for how to continue the project.</span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.u6s7yng6lq0h"><span class="c20 c8">Preparing for a Design Sprint</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to accomplish this process, there are certain people that need to be present and certain things happening in the background to support this process and there is also a followup iteration sprint that will take place soon after these initial 5 days. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A Design Sprint requires a few very specific people, one of the most important is the official &ldquo;Decider&rdquo;. This is a person with enough authority and budget to make the prototyping and testing happen in the short time that is. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Building the team - who should be there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Below is a list of the different types of people that can be included. Not each of these people needs to be in every sprint but who attends will depend on the topic. Always included should be the Facilitator and a Decider. The rest will depend on the topic and teams should be kept to seven or fewer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24">Facilitator. </span><span class="c1">The person that is responsible for guiding the process and keeping time who is not involved in the content.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24">A decider. </span><span class="c1">Whether this is the CEO or the Project Manager of a specific issue, they should be there for this process because the decisions need to be made on the spot. If this person cannot be there for the whole time, then they should designate the role to someone who can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24">Finance expert.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This person needs to be able to explain where the money comes from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24">Marketing expert. </span><span class="c1">The person who knows and crafts the messages for the company. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24">Customer expert.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This person is in regular contact with customers in various ways. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24">Tech expert.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This person understands what the company can build and deliver.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24">Design expert.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This person is involved in designing the products/services of the company.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Design Sprint teams should always look to have diversity in them to make sure that different perspectives are taken into consideration. </span></p><h4 class="c4" id="h.uhi07vum31fz"><span class="c37">Rules and Tools</span></h4><p class="c0"><span class="c24">No distractions.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;No laptops, phones, or iPads allowed</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24">Keep to the timing </span><span class="c1">- builds confidence in the process</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c24">Schedule extra experts.</span><span>&nbsp;Not every expert can be in the sprint all week.
